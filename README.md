# [ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00631)

## Overview
This repository is the official implementation of ROSE [1].

## Environment Set-up

To get started with the repo, you can easily create the conda environment using the provided environment.yml file.
```setup
conda env create -n rose -f environment.yml
conda activate rose
# then use pip install fast-jl
pip install fast-jl==0.1.3

```


## Dataset

We follow the [LESS](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LESS?tab=readme-ov-file#less-selecting-influential-data-for-targeted-instruction-tuning) [2] to prepare four instruction-tuning datasets: Flan v2, COT, Dolly, and Open Assistant. For validation, we constructed few-shot datasets in both SFT and preference formats using SE, SHP, and SE datasets. All (train, test, validation) datasets are all included in the ./data folder.

## ROSE Data Selection
All steps are compiled into the ./run/run_rose.sh file. You can start the process using the ./run_from_start.sh script (with configuration setting).

```bash
./run/run_from_start.sh
```
