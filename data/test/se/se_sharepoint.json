It has its own infrastructure and the Provider is responsible for keeping it running. They allow you to use Server Side code and uses the .NET CSOM (not the Microsoft.SharePoint.dll [technically you can host a Provider hosted app in the same server as sharepoint with an app pool that has the security requirements to access SharePoint's server side components {but you should probably avoid doing this}]</p>\n\n<p>Compared to SharePoint Hosted Apps, they are much more powerful as they can leverage resources the a Client-Side only app simply cannot use.</p>\n\n<p>In an on premises environment, you also have the alternative of developing High Trust Provider Hosted Apps, this model allows the App to tell SharePoint WHO the app is acting as and can effectively Impersonate users and do things that the app or the user running the app does not have permission to do (thus the name High Trust).</p>\n\n<p>A Provider Hosted app can still have it's SharePoint Hosted counterpart, earning itself an AppWeb and running client side code that has support from SharePoint like the ListView Controls and owning content that are \"isolated\" from the rest of the site collection.</p>\n\n<p>Hope I've described this clearly, feel free to point out htings that might've come out confusing.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>In short you as the other answer says, you will need to dispose of those objects as you created them.</p>\n\n<p>However, to help keep the code a bit cleaner, easier to maintain and also so you dont have to create SPWeb lots of times, why not move the SPWeb and SPSite objects out of the function and make them as private members of the class. You can then create the object once and dispose of it when your web part is cleaned up within the Dispose() function.</p>\n\n<p>This is an approach I also take when I want to use SPSite or SPWeb objects within a custom class.

With the Dispose() function implemented you can then choose when the objects are disposed of. </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately the WebPart class already implements the IDisposable() function so  you can override that with your own implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I use a similar pattern to one that you have used and create a boolean variable which says whether the dispose function needs to dispose of the object or not. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway here is a quick example, hope it helps:-</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyWebPart : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart, IDisposable\n{\n\nprivate SPSite _site=null;\nprivate SPWeb _web=null;\nprivate bool _needDisposal=false;\n\npublic MyWebPart()\n{\n\n}\n\npublic void Initialise()\n{\nif(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(_siteUrl))\n{\n_site=new SPSite(_siteUrl);\n_web=site.OpenWeb()\n_needDisposal=true;\n}\n}\n}\n\n/// do stuff\n\n\npublic void Dispose() \n{\n\nif(_needDisposal)\n{\n  if(_web!=null)\n  {\n    _web.Dispose();\n    _hasBeenDisposed=true;\n  }\n\n  if(_site!=null)\n  {\n    _site.Dispose();\n    _hasBeenDisposed=true;\n  }\n}\n\n}\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"

One is about 130GB and the other is 40GB. I know MS recommends databases be around the 100GB, but it also states they can be as large as 200GB. I copied the DBs to our dev server and used DBCC to check for index fragmentation and even reindexed the databases to rule out problems with the databases. Everything came back fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here is our current config:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 WFE's 12GB RAM, 4 core processors @ 2.6GHz, VM </li>\n<li>1 App Server, 8GB\nRAM, 4 core processors @ 2.6GHz, VM </li>\n<li>1 DB Server, SQL 2008, Physical\nserver. Not sure of the specs but I am sure they pretty beefy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just as an experiment, I tried creating sites with powershell. I noticed that when I create a site without specifying a template, it is created in seconds. Follwing that, when I access the site I have to select a template. The first time I selected the team template. As expected, it took forever. The second time I selected the blank site template, which took about 27 seconds to create the site.</p>\n\n<p>I am at a loss as to why these to site collections are so slow. Could there be something wrong with our team site template? How do you troubleshoot that?</p>\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1/20/15: I am still not able to find the source of the slowness. I have run profiler and DBCC against the database, reindexed, etc but performance is still slow. May have to consult with our contractor...</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

If you want more detail you can run  SQL profiler which will tell you which operations are actually your bottle neck.  </p>\n\n<p>There are multiple points where things can get held up.  It may be that requests are being queued and so they can't move off the SharePoint server, or they are held at SQL.

I would reference it here, but I can't seem to find it now. Anyway, the approach was:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a view that filters the way you want the alert to filter.</li>\n<li>Setup an alert on that view.</li>\n<li>Programmatically, look at that alert and look at the filter.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The reason this works is because the alert isn't actually tied to the view, it copies the filter. So if the view changes, the alert will be out of sync with it.</p>\n\n<p>So I setup a quick test with a multi-select metadata site column, creatively named ManagedMetadata, containing some fruits and vegetables, created a list that used the field, and a view that only showed items with Broccoli as a value. Finally, I created an alert on that view. Then I created some items with and without Broccoli and checked that the alert works, which it does.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I launch the debug console and run this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var ctx = SP.ClientContext.get_current();\nvar web = ctx.get_web();\nvar alerts = web.get_alerts();\n\nctx.load(web);\nctx.load(alerts);\n\nctx.executeQueryAsync(\n    function() {\n        var en = alerts.getEnumerator();\n        while (en.moveNext()) {\n            console.log(en.get_current());\n        }\n    },\n    function(sender, args) {\n        console.log(args.get_message());\n    }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I run that code, this what gets dumped for that alert:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6L4b.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z6L4b.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The actual filter is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Query&gt;&lt;Eq&gt;&lt;FieldRef Name=\\\"ManagedMetadata\\\"/&gt;&lt;Value type=\\\"string\\\"&gt;brocoli&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Eq&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only difference I see is that the value type is set to <code>string</code> instead of <code>text</code> like you have.

I make it a habit of removing all but 3 versions of these documents manually (in the Version History) whenever I find them. I am also thinking about a workflow to do this for all documents in a library.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:\nAssuming you activated the \"Keep the following number of major versions\" and set its value to 3 only after documents in document library has been uploaded/edited (creating more than 3 versions), you have to edit the document or manually delete unwanted versions in order to trigger the new configuration and only retain the last 3 versions of any document.</p>\n"

Second, you can create a PDF template in Acrobat, add form fields, and store the file in SiteAssets or some other doc library.  Then when you need to generate the file, your code would load the PDF template with form fields from the doc library, set the form field values from your web part input using iTextSharp, remove the fields so they are no longer editable, then write them to the output stream or save the file in a document library.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can look in to Work Automation as previously mentioned, and I am sure there are third party products that can handle PDF generation.</p>\n\n<p>Lou Estrada</p>\n"

Instead I got the dreaded \"the query string accountName is missing or invalid\" response.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried fooling around a little in my browser and soon noticed # is not automatically URL-encoded. So I thought maybe that's the case in the url I enter for the workflow action Call HTTP web service also, so I ran an action of string replace on the initiators login name, replacing # with %23.</p>\n\n<p>Now I get a http 200 response but nothing more, I log the responseCode, the responseHeaders and the reponseContent, only the responseCode has any content in the history log. This also made the workflow never finish. The workflow is still listed as running on the testsite.</p>\n\n<p>I tried calling the /gertmyproperties endpoint instead, it acts the same, http 200 OK but the workflow just keeps running and no content is returned.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT 2 - 2016-12-18</p>\n\n<p>So I read the whole article above once again and noticed the author use an other endpoint and that he also URL-encode the : character to %3A.</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing endpoint using the one in the article /getuserprofilepropertyfor(accountName=@v,propertyName='Manager')?@v='urlEncodedUsername'</p>\n\n<p>This works, it returns the Managerproperty from the userprofile object. But, my workflows are still showing as \"in progress\" in the Settings->Workflow Settings page on the SharePoint site.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried calling both with URL-encoding the : and without, both seems to work, also tried with and without URL-encoding the ' character, no difference.

A site workflow might be better suited, but that would require developing your own actions in Visual Studio, since the default actions for site workflows in SP2010 do not include looping through list items (or even invoking web services!). Some third party workflow add-ons, like those offered by <strong>K2</strong> and <strong>Nintex</strong>, add a fancier workflow interface and more custom actions that could easily achieve what you're looking for, but for a one-time update like this, they seem like overkill. </p>\n\n<p>If you have access to log in to the web front end servers, a custom Powershell script will be the path of least resistance. Just start the <em>SharePoint Management Shell</em> (<strong>Start</strong> -> <strong>All Programs</strong> -> <strong>Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Products</strong> -> <strong>SharePoint 2010 Management Shell</strong>) and you can use Powershell to directly and programmatically access the SharePoint object model. </p>\n\n<pre><code>$web = get-spweb http://server/site\n$list = $web.lists[\"Your Library Name\"]\n$list.Items | foreach-object { $file = $_.file; $file.MoveTo(\"destination url\"); $file.Update();}\n$web.dispose()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of typing the commands directly into the console, you can save a complete script to a text file with the extension <code>.ps1</code> and then execute it from the management shell by typing <code>&amp;\"filename.ps1</code>\" (replacing <code>filename.ps1</code> with the path to your file, which you can get by holding shift and right-clicking on the file, then selecting \"<strong>copy as path</strong>\").</p>\n\n<p>Note that if you have exceeded the list view threshold, accessing <code>$list.Items</code> will likely fail due to size. You can temporarily disable throttling on the list by executing <code>$list.EnableThrottling = $false</code>. Alternatively, you can query the list using an <strong>SPQuery</strong> object to access a smaller subset of the items at a time, paging through the results until the entire list is processed.</p>\n\n<p>I'm guessing you'll need a more complicated Powershell script than the barebones example above, but I recommend asking a new question for assistance (after searching for any relevant existing questions) if you do decide to go that route.</p>\n"

We used it to make a table with a footer that we place informational text and links.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;table style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; text-align: center;\"&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td style=\"width: 100%;\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- slider image appears here as background --&gt;\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;!-- ↓ OPTIONAL IMAGE CAPTION ↓ --&gt;\n        &lt;tr style=\"background: white; height: 50px; \n        border-top-color: #cdd0d4; border-top-width: 1px; \n        border-top-style: solid;\"&gt;\n            &lt;td style=\"width: 100%;\"&gt;\n                &lt;span&gt;Caption text about your slide&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You still need to plant the images somewhere, so I tried adding this approach.<br><br>\n• Attach the image directly to the promoted list item used to configure the slide.<br>\n• Use a workflow to get the attachment path and name and put it in the field that defines the image address.<br>\n• Now the list can hold the slider caption, order configuration and the image. <br><br><b>Caution</b>: slider will show without an image if field is left blank while waiting the workflow to run. So be sure to use a default image for that space.</p>\n\n<p>*not affiliated with PAIT in any way, just a lucky find :)</p>\n"

Mind that I did this in an isolated test environment and the approach is a bit raw, so use it at your own risk (ideally, make at least some kind of DB backup before you do it) - it worked for me. Note also that this procedure will result in an unsupported state as it alters the database directly.</p>\n\n<p>First, I followed these instructions: <a href=\"http://techilatalk.com/remove-spmanagedaccount-not-working/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techilatalk.com/remove-spmanagedaccount-not-working/</a> (this step alone didn't resolve the error for me, but it seems a good place to start).</p>\n\n<p>Then, when all else failed, I executed an UPDATE on the config database that replaced all <code>OldDomain\\Admin</code> values with <code>NewDomain\\Admin</code> values in the <code>[dbo].[Objects]</code> table, xml column <code>[Properties]</code>. Here's how: first, open SQL Server Management Studio. On the <code>SharePoint_Config</code> database (or whatever it's named in your case), execute the following query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>UPDATE [SharePoint_Config].[dbo].[Objects] \nSET [Properties] = REPLACE( CAST( [Properties] as varchar(max) ), 'OldDomain\\Admin', 'NewDomain\\Admin')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will replace old account names with the new ones. Note that in general, if you have multiple user accounts, you may need to replace values for all users, i.e. you'd replace 'OldDomain\\' with 'NewDomain\\', rather than limiting a query to a specific user.</p>\n\n<p>Now make sure that the [Properties] xml column in [Objects] table doesn't have any more references to the old domain - the following query should return an empty result set:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT Id,CAST([Properties] as xml)\nFrom [SharePoint_Config].[dbo].[Objects]\nWHERE Properties LIKE '%OldDomain\\%'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you don't get an empty result set, insepct the xml of the returned records and see if there are any more references to the old domain that need to be updated.</p>\n\n<p>Do an iisreset after this, wait a minute or two and it should work (in my case this means that I can now view job definitions without getting an error + all other problems went away).</p>\n"

Older versions support progressively fewer features for non-IE browsers.</p>\n\n<p>This means unless you have SQL Server 2016, using Chrome for reporting services is going to mean compatibility issues. To work around this there are a couple of possible solutions:</p>\n\n<p>1) In a corporate environment, consider using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3019558?hl=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Legacy Browser Support</a> extension for Chrome - this requires Group Policy settings to force some URLs to open in an IE window.</p>\n\n<p>2) Use the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IE Tab extension</a> in Chrome to render certain sites using the IE rendering engine, but inside a Chrome tab.</p>\n"

I created the page, inserted a script editor web part at the top, and inserted this snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    $(function () {\n        $(\"#accordion\").accordion({collapsible: true, active: false, icons:false });\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, I put the cursor under the script editor web part, and clicked on \"Edit Source\".  Then underneath the HTML that represents the script editor, I put this HTML (basically the jQuery accordion demo HTML):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"accordion\"&gt;\n   &lt;h3&gt;\n      Section 1\n   &lt;/h3&gt;\n   &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Mauris mauris ante, blandit et, ultrices a, suscipit eget, quam.

If I go back into edit mode for the page, it works as expected - clicking a header expands the section.  Save it again, and it stops working.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?  I don't think what I'm trying to do is all that complicated...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 12/8:</strong>\nOk, so I put the jQuery and jQuery UI scripts in the site's Site Assets folder, and the behavior is the same -- the scripts do not get loaded in IE or Firefox unless the page is in Edit mode.  Incidentally I think the other script snippet, where I hook up the accordion, is also not getting loaded unless the page is in edit mode.  The reason I think this is that I changed the way I referenced the main jQuery script (to something that didn't work), and the debugger halted on <code>$(function () { ....</code>, saying <code>$</code> was undefined.</p>\n\n<p>So if jQuery is not loaded, and the debugger thinks <code>$</code> is undefined, at least it's hitting that section of code.  Which makes me think that in non-edit mode, not only is jQuery not getting loaded, but that section of script is not getting loaded either, because the debugger is not choking on <code>$</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone provide any insight as to why the Script Editor web part seems to be not working in IE and Firefox?  (Because apparently in Chrome it works fine.)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
