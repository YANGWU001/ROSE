        "golden_answer": " <p>Your disk has no boot loaders. My <em>educated guess</em> about what happened, based on your description, is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.</li>\n<li>When you tried to install Windows 7, you booted in EFI/UEFI mode, so it complained about the MBR partition table and you converted it to GPT and installed Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. This would have rendered Windows bootable and Ubuntu unbootable. This could have been repaired, but....</li>\n<li>You booted Boot Repair in BIOS mode, and proceeded to trash the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition\" rel=\"nofollow\">EFI System Partition</a> that held the Windows boot loader, thus rendering Windows unbootable; and for whatever reason, Boot Repair was unable to get Linux booting again.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At this point, I recommend you <a href=\"http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/csm-good-bad-ugly.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">read my page on the CSM and its perils</a> for background information. Without an understanding of the CSM, you're likely to dig yourself into the same hole again.</p>\n\n<p>It's almost always best to install both OSes in a dual-boot in the same boot mode -- that is, both in BIOS mode or both in EFI mode. Mixing boot modes is a recipe for disaster. Furthermore, given the way most EFIs are designed, it's usually best if that boot mode be EFI; as my page describes, using BIOS mode turns the boot process into a complicated mess that's as likely to lead to problems as to a successful boot. Thus, I have some specific suggestions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disable your CSM.</strong> This is the single most important thing to do.</li>\n<li>Change the type code of <code>/dev/sdc1</code> so that it's an ESP. (It's currently marked as a BIOS Boot Partition, which is useless for EFI-mode booting.) Note that there's a chance that this partition still holds the Windows boot loader, so correctly marking it as an ESP might be all you need to do to get Windows booting; but you may need to create a new FAT32 filesystem on it and do more repairs. You can change the type code using <code>gdisk</code> by changing it from EF02 to EF00; or with <code>parted</code> or GParted by removing the <code>bios_grub</code> flag and replacing it with a <code>boot</code> flag.</li>\n<li>Re-install the Windows boot loader using Windows tools. You should ask for details of how to do this on a Windows forum.</li>\n<li>Install an EFI boot loader for Linux. There are a couple of relatively simple ways to do this:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use Boot Repair, but boot the repair disk <em>in EFI mode</em>. (If you can't boot in EFI mode, the disk is probably prepared incorrectly. My page on the CSM that I referenced earlier goes into this subject in detail.)</li>\n<li>Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R image of my <a href=\"http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">rEFInd boot manager.</a> (Images for both are on that page.) Boot with it, and using rEFInd, boot Ubuntu. You can then install rEFInd to the hard disk using the Debian package or PPA.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Instead of those last two top-level bullet points, you could re-install one or both OSes -- but be sure to do so using the same boot mode (preferably EFI mode). Note that this will go best if you disable the CSM and fix the type code of your ESP.</p>\n"

I don't like the idea that X-scaling &quot;uses more resources&quot; because this suggests some on-the-fly interpolation scheme which, apart from introduced latency, will almost certainly not play nice with sub-pixel font rendering, and will probably screw up integer scaling on graphical programs. Wayland by contrast just doesn't work with this configuration - multiple problems and basically crashes. So essentially I'd like to code in a terminal on the low-res TTY monitor, and have the main high DPI monitor run X (or wayland) with 100% scaling, no screwing around, though I'd probably <a href=\"https://linuxreviews.org/HOWTO_set_DPI_in_Xorg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">raise the DPI setting</a>.</p>\n<p>Is this possible on one video card (Radeon VII).

For this and other reasons, I expect I will prefer vanilla Ubuntu over any of its derivatives on all my future installs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question - Feb 26, 2019</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the (distant?) past, I could assign a MAC address to a network interface by adding the following stanza to to <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto         eth0\niface        eth0\n  hwaddress  00:12:34:56:78:9a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As of Lubuntu 18.04, this no longer works (because the <code>ifupdown</code> package is not installed by default).</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what configuration file do I edit, and how do I edit it, so that NetworkManager will assign the fixed MAC address of my choice to <code>eth0</code>.</p>\n\n<p>(Aside: Yes, I know that by default Ubuntu 18.04 renames <code>eth0</code> to a \"predictable\" name like <code>enp1s0</code>.  I have already disabled that renaming, so I do indeed have an <code>eth0</code> interface on my system.)</p>\n\n<p>I have glanced at the following documentation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.conf.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Gnome NetworkManager.conf documentation</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nm-settings.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Gnome nm-settings documentation</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2016/08/26/mac-address-spoofing-in-networkmanager-1-4-0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thomas Haller's Blog - MAC Address Spoofing in NetworkManager 1.4.0</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on the above documentation, I tried adding something like the below to <code>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[device]\nmatch-device=interface-name:eth0\nethernet.assigned-mac-address=00:22:68:1c:59:b1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the above does not seem to work.</p>\n\n<p>My use case is that I have installed Lubuntu onto a USB stick.  Upon boot of the USB stick on any system, I want NetworkManager to assign a predetermined and fixed MAC address to <code>eth0</code>.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>I have a mouse with lots of buttons, but it's not a mainstream make like Logitech. For Windows, I have a driver that lets me assign actions like close-window (Ctrl+W) or next-tab (Ctrl+Tab), but I don't have a Linux driver. Since Linux is so flexible, I thought perhaps there is a general way to do this, regardless of brand?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Based on input from Cyrex, I installed and ran <code>sudo apt-get install btnx</code> which found several but not all mouse buttons.<br>\nFound: left, right, wheel, wheelclick, thumb fwd, thumb back.<br>\n<strong>Not found:</strong> wheel left, wheel right, thumb middle button.<br>\nVendor ID is 0x04d9, Model ID is 0xa015.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> In System>Prefs>Mouse there's a lightbulb icon for testing double-click speed. Every working button can turn the bulb on&amp;off, but the missing buttons can't. <strong>It would seem that Ubuntu isn't aware of these buttons and thus doesn't register their clicks.</strong> I guess I need to hunt for a driver, though a mainstream mouse is probably the easier way. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>I have a MX Anywhere \"M-R0001\"</p>\n\n<p>I use my forward and Back buttons as Copy and Paste. </p>\n\n<p>Steps:<br>\n1) All buttons are detected with last kernel... at least with</p>\n\n<pre><code>uname -a\n\n3.8.0-25-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 6 20:47:07 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2) So, basically, you only need to map those buttons with desired actions. How to know with button is pressed and the correspondent numeric code? Well, you can use the 'xev' program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This program is a key and mouse events sniffer. When it's running, you can see a window in which you can press mouse buttons and see if they are detected. For example, with the zoom button of the Performance MX you will see something like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ButtonPress event, serial 35, synthetic NO, window 0x5800001,\n    root 0x15a, subw 0x0, time 64521438, (84,117), root88,144),\n    state 0x10, button 13, same_screen YES\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that means that 13 is the code for that mouse button. You can try every mouse buttons on your hand  ... for easy access, here is the map for Performance MX:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Back button: 8  </li>\n<li>Forward button: 9  </li>\n<li>Zoom button: 13  </li>\n<li>Show windows button: 10  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>the other buttons are well recognized and you don't need to map to actions.</p>\n\n<p>3) Now, you need to install a little program to re-map mouse and keyboard inputs. The magician is 'xbindkeys' ... the easy installation is using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4) Once installed, you can do the magic. The idea is configure the mouse buttons to send key combinations to activate other desktop functionalities (as the matter of fact, xbindkeys can be used for execute any other program when you press a mouse button). In KDE you can do that with Ctrl+F10 keys combination. The point is create a xbindkeys' configuration file to do the job.</p>\n\n<p>5) To create the configuration file, just run the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xbindkeys --defaults &gt; $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>6) And we need to edit the file to specify your button's mapping:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gedit $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>7) We need to add our button-to-key configurations. For example, I have the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Back changed to Copy\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key C' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:8\n\n# Forward\n\"xte 'keydown Alt_L' 'key Right' 'keyup Alt_L'\"\n  b:9\n\n# Present desktops\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F8' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:13\n\n# Present windows\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F10' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b:10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>8) There was a new requirement. the 'xte' program, which basically simulates user key press combinations. Install it using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xautomation\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, if you run on a terminal something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F10' 'keyup Control_L'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>that means simulate a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> keypress. The idea is using xbindkeys to say: \"when I press 13th mouse button, send a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> keyboard press using xte program to generate that\"</p>\n\n<p>9) And finally, you need to configure 'xbindkeys' to run automatically on system startup. Startup Applications / Add program button and type '/usr/bin/xbindkeys' on the dialog.</p>\n\n<p>DONE </p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>The process kswapd0 is the process that manages virtual memory. Your machine <em>should</em> have RAM, SWAP, and the EXT4 on your HDD/SSD. The ext4 is where everything is stored, and it is always slower to access than RAM. RAM is like a half-way running space for programs to access information quickly. Most computers have at least 4GB of RAM, which under normal conditions is plenty. When playing a game, however, you may run low on RAM space, which is where SWAP comes in. </p>\n\n<p>SWAP is a fake RAM located on your HDD/SSD next to your EXT4. It is quicker to access than the EXT4, but it is much slower than actual RAM. When you run low on memory, kswapd0 moves programs that you are not using/not using as much as other programs to the SWAP, which causes extreme lag on those processes. If your game was needing 5GB RAM, 1GB at LEAST would be in SWAP. That means when it tries to access that information, it has to wait longer to get it. </p>\n\n<p>This entire process causes extreme CPU usage, moving information from and to SWAP and RAM and handling the request of information all at the same time. How to solve this  issue?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tell kswapd0 to only move stuff to SWAP when you are completely OUT of RAM. This is the single most effective method to resolving SWAP issues. Run </p>\n\n<p><code>echo vm.swappiness=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf</code></p>\n\n<p>where <code>0</code> is the percent left out of <code>100</code> at which SWAP should be used (when you have 0% RAM left, SWAP will start taking in data). You can also just edit /etc/sysctl.conf to your liking instead of adding this command to the end of it everytime using gedit or nano or whatever, be sure to sudo though, this file is root owned.

This command line invokes WSL and ask it to start \"Ubuntu\" which is done in the current directory, i.e. if you run <code>wsl.exe -d Ubuntu</code> while in Desktop of Windows, Ubuntu will start on Windows' Desktop. </p>\n\n<p>As a workaround, you can modify the command line and use one of the below.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Since WSL is specifically for Linux, thus <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tilde Expansion</a> can be expected from that. Therefore, you can specify the \"starting directory\" in the command line and use the following as the value of command line.</p>\n\n<pre><code>wsl.exe ~ -d ubuntu\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>When Ubuntu app is installed, it automatically registers <code>ubuntu</code> command. Therefore, <code>ubuntu</code> command will invoke Ubuntu App. The benefit of this is that it always starts at <code>$HOME</code>. Therefore, you can change the value of command-line to</p>\n\n<pre><code>ubuntu\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04 app, the command would vary accordingly.

I have an established home web server (I am the only admin/user) that runs Apache and hosts my web pages.  I have MySQL installed, and was able to create and query a database through Terminal.  I have PHP installed, and can use echo to print text to the document.  When I work with MySQL however, everything changes…</p>\n\n<p>I have a page that contains initialization stuff in .  contains a few paragraphs of hardcoded HTML and then PHP code to access MySQL.  When I first loaded the page, all that resulted was a blank page.  I commented out the PHP section and reloaded to confirm that the plain HTML still worked, which it did.  Therefore, some part of PHP was keeping any of the page from ever loading.  </p>\n\n<p>To begin troubleshooting my code, I left all of the PHP code commented except the following code for the server connection, which is adapted from several different tutorials:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?\necho(\"&lt;p&gt;PHP is working&lt;/p&gt;\"); \n$ses = mysql_connect(\"localhost\",\"username\",\"password\");\nif(!$ses){\n echo(\"&lt;p&gt;Connection to content server failed.&lt;/p&gt;\");\n exit();\n}\necho(\"&lt;p&gt;Database Connected&lt;/p&gt;\");\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the page is loaded, the beginning HTML loads in addition to a paragraph reading “PHP is working” but neither the failure or success message appear.  I removed the If structure from the code - so that only two echos and the mysql_connect remained – and got the same result.  </p>\n\n<p>It seems that the mysql_connect feature is causing the server to stop loading the code when it is run, but I’m out of ideas for how to fix it.  For the record: I’ve modified the php.ini file to include the “connection = msql.so” line, and I’m using MySQL 5.5, Apache 2.2.22, PHP 5.3.10, Ubuntu 12.04.  Also, both my router and modem have been configured to forward port 3306 to the server – though I don’t see how that should be necessary – and my MySQL username and password have been triple checked and are identical to the ones that I use successfully in Terminal.</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

I wouldn't bother getting that specific though. I believe Microsoft incorrectly refers to megabytes so your sizing should actually be correct anyways. However if you have a Windows installation or Windows installation disc you could verify your MSR shows up as the correct size in megabytes under Windows. You can do this in the Windows terminal by typing \"diskpart\" which is a cli partitioning tool. Then \"select disk0\", and \"list partitions\". </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that unless you are using software that is designed to use hidden sectors you don't actually need an MSR.

The encryption is handled by an extra software layer between the file system and the physical hard drive, not the file system itself.</p>\n<p>There is no simple method or tool to undo this. With some knowledge about how Linux systems work, it can be done. You'd have to move the whole file system (or all files) to another partition (with enough free space) or external HDD. Then, remove the encrypted container, and recreate the file system without encryption. Finally, make sure that the new file system  is properly recognized by the boot loader and <code>mount -a</code> before rebooting.</p>\n<p>If possible, it's best to avoid this time consuming and error-prone procedure. Just do a fresh install. For a new user, this is the quickest and safest option.</p>\n<p>PS: Chances are that you can change the encryption passphrase, possibly to an empty string. Then decrypting only requires to press Enter. Maybe you can go further and supress to (now useless) passphrase prompt. However, this does not disable the encryption.

I used <code>resizeStack</code> in Terminal to shrink the OS X partition (<a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134498/unable-to-resize-partitions\">guide here</a>). Now the SSD is partitioned as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/dev/sda1</code>: EFI partition</li>\n<li><code>/dev/sda2</code>: OS X Yosemite</li>\n<li><code>/dev/sda3</code>: OS X Recovery HD</li>\n<li><code>/dev/sda4</code>: Boot Camp Windows 8</li>\n<li><code>/dev/sda5</code>: Ubuntu Disk mounted to <code>/</code></li>\n<li><code>/dev/sda6</code>: Ubuntu <code>Swap</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Ubuntu boot loader is selected to install to <code>/dev/sda1</code>, but the installer notified that the Windows Boot Loader also exists in <code>sda1</code>. After installation, Ubuntu and Mac OS successfully booted from GRUB2, but the Windows cannot be booted either from GRUB2 or from the native Apple boot manager (pressing <code>option</code> when booting). <strong>I used Parallels Desktop to load the Boot Camp partition as a Virtual Machine and the Windows works.</strong></p>\n<h1>Solution #1</h1>\n<p>I installed <em>Boot Repair</em> on Ubuntu and used the <em>Recommended Repair</em>, no luck; more entries are added to the Grub2 menu after repair. GRUB worked and Mac OS could be booted. Here is the Boot Info page created: <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/11897269/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/11897269/</a></p>\n<h1>Solution #2</h1>\n<p>I plugged in the Windows Installation flash drive and tried the automatic <em>Startup Repair</em>, which did not work. Then I attempted to repair the Master Boot Record by Command Prompt:\n<code>bootrec /fixmbr</code></p>\n<p>After the repair Mac OS was set to be the first system to boot, so Grub menu did not appear while starting the computer. I used <code>efibootmgr</code> on the Ubuntu Installation flash drive to set back Ubuntu to be the first boot drive and Mac OS to be the second. Windows still cannot be booted.</p>\n<p>The weird thing is that this time the Apple boot manager did not attempt to boot Windows after the &quot;Windows&quot; disk icon is clicked; both the &quot;Macintosh HD&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; icon will lead to Mac OS being booted. So <strong>the repair must have changed the Apple boot manager.</strong></p>\n<h1>Several Questions</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Seems that the Windows Boot Loader in <code>/dev/sda1</code> is overwritten by Grub. So is there a way to make the Windows Boot Loader and Linux boot loader (it is Grub now, right?) coexist?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A thing to notice is that <strong>the Boot Camp Windows 8 boots in EFI mode on MacBook Pro</strong>, as the <code>setupact.log</code> shows <code>Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: EFI</code>. <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/464760/how-to-tell-if-windows-7-installer-boot-in-efi-or-bios\">guide</a> I also checked Grub that it works in EFI mode. Therefore does Windows also use GUID Partition Table (GPT) similar as Mac OS, instead of MBR? If so repairing MBR may not be useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I am not sure where does the Apple boot switch reside, and how it can be changed by the Windows Installation drive? Is it also in <code>/dev/sda1</code>?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am a beginner on the subject.

The 0xEE partition is often called the \"protective partition.\" This has nothing to do with an \"EFI partition,\" \"BIOS boot partition,\" or any other GPT partition, except to the extent that the protective MBR is a necessary component of a complete GPT configuration. The protective partition isn't really a partition, either; it exists just to keep GPT-unaware utilities from messing with the disk.</li>\n<li>On a computer that boots in EFI mode, an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_System_partition\" rel=\"nofollow\">EFI System Partition (ESP)</a> is required. This partition uses a FAT32 filesystem (FAT16 can usually work in practice, but the spec requires FAT32) and holds EFI boot loaders and related files. When the computer boots, the EFI reads boot loaders from the ESP. Its size is not defined by the spec, but in practice it's usually around 100-200MiB. I recommend creating a bigger ESP, in the range of 550MiB, because some EFIs seem to have buggy FAT drivers that cause problems with smaller ESPs.</li>\n<li>If you install GRUB <em>in BIOS mode</em> to a GPT disk, it will be happiest if the disk contains a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_Boot_partition\" rel=\"nofollow\">BIOS Boot Partition</a>. This partition is typically 1MiB or 2MiB in size, and it holds the second stage of GRUB's boot code (the first stage goes in the MBR's code area). This partition is <em>not</em> required when booting a computer in EFI mode.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ESP and BIOS Boot Partition can both go just about anywhere, at least in theory, although on an over-2GiB disk, it's best to keep the BIOS Boot Partition under the 2GiB mark.</p>\n"
