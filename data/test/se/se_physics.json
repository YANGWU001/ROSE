        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>Any light field can be expressed as a sum of plane waves. Such an ensemble of plane waves is called the plane wave spectrum of the light field. The plane wave spectrum is the Fourier transform of the light field in the real space representation.</p>\n\n<p>Since, this is such a basic technique, I wonder whether there is a standard tool, preferably open-source, with a simple interface via Python, Matlab or similar, to do the following (numerically):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start with a light field in real space, say a monochromatic *-Gaussian beam.</li>\n<li>compute the Fourier transform</li>\n<li>apply some operation that changes the plane wave spectrum, say a boundary between two media</li>\n<li>compute the inverse Fourier transfrom</li>\n<li>produce some output, e.g. a plot</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Computationally, all it takes is a library to perform the FFT. I'm looking for a framework that would wrap this along with some phyiscal concepts.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>The reason that these sorts of libraries don't exist is because the particular algorithm that you use to do the calculation will depend upon the exact details of the light field and the input and output planes you are trying to compute.</p>\n\n<p>For example, let me outline the the simplest case for this sort of calcualtion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The input light field $g_0$ has a slowly varying phase profile</li>\n<li>You want to propagate a short distance relative to the size of the beam (or, in a more pure-mathematical approach, your input field has infinite extent)</li>\n<li>The input and output planes are parallel and differ only by a translation along the z-axis</li>\n<li>The input and output computation grids have the same spacing</li>\n<li>This grid spacing is sufficiently small to nyquist sample the (spatially band-limited) input field.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this case, you can easily use the angular spectrum propagation (ASP) method with FFTs to quickly compute your propagated wavefront. You seem to understand basic scalar diffraction, but to clarify for other readers, this means you compute:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\begin{eqnarray}\r\nG_0(\\xi,\\eta) = \\mathcal{F}\\left[ g_0(x,y) \\right] \\\\\r\nG_z(\\xi,\\eta) = A_z(\\xi,\\eta)G_0(\\xi,\\eta) \\\\\r\ng_z(x,y) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[ G_z(\\xi,\\eta) \\right]\r\n\\end{eqnarray}$$</p>\n\n<p>Where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the fourier transform from spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ to spatial frequency coordinates $(\\xi,\\eta)$, and $A_z(\\xi,\\eta)$ is the propagation kernel for distance $z$. In the future I will simply let capital letters denote Fourier transform of corresponding lower case letters. We typically define for ASP:</p>\n\n<p>$$ A_z(\\xi,\\eta) = \\exp \\left[ i 2 \\pi \\frac{z}{\\lambda} \\sqrt{1- (\\lambda \\xi)^2 - (\\lambda \\eta)^2} \\right]$$</p>\n\n<p>where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.</p>\n\n<p>However, this quickly falls apart if any of the conditions I outlined above are not satisfied. If the input field varies too rapidly (or conversely if the computation grid isn't fine enough to Nyquist sample those variations) then you will have severe aliasing in the Fourier transforms, and your result will be corrupted. If the input and output planes aren't parallel, you simply cannot use this method as it is formulated. If you need the output grid to be sampled differently than the input grid, then an FFT algorithm will no longer work, because the essential trade-off that you make for the speed of an FFT is that you cannot select arbitrary points to compute in Fourier space.</p>\n\n<p>There are other propagation techniques of course. Lets say you have a converging beam, such as that immediately after a focusing lens. Barring an extremely fine computation grid spacing, or a very long focal length lens, ASP will fail because $G_0$ will be badly aliased. This is the textbook example of the applicability of <em>Fresnel diffraction</em>:</p>\n\n<p>$$ g_z(x,y) = \\frac{e^{i k z}}{i \\lambda z} e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda z} (x^2 + y^2)} \\mathcal{F} \\left[ g_0(u,v) e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda z} (u^2 + v^2)} \\right] $$</p>\n\n<p>where $(u,v)$ are spatial coordinates in the input plane.</p>\n\n<p>If we consider the input field $g_0$ to be composed of the product of a quadratic phase front $q(x,y) = \\exp \\left[-i \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda \\mathcal{f}} (x^2 + y^2) \\right]$ (representing the phase of the converging lens of focal length $\\mathcal{f}$) and a residual flat component $s_0(x,y)$, we can see that over some range of propagation distances, the quadratic phase term inside the Fourier transform will act to \"flatten\" the transformed function such that there is no aliasing. Indeed, when $\\mathcal{f} = z$ the transformed field will equal to the roughly flat $s_0$! In this case the resulting computation is basically identical to yet another propagation technique, <em>Fraunhofer Diffraction</em>, neglecting the minor detail of the quadratic phase term outside of the Fourier transform in Fresnel diffraction, and a scaling from angular coordinates to spatial coordinates.</p>\n\n<p>Even with Fresnel/Fraunhoffer diffraction, we still run into problems if the propagation distance is too small. Note that the term $e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda z} (u^2 + v^2)}$ will have very high curvature when $z$ is small, once again producing aliasing problems in the Fourier transform. Typically, the solution to this is to propagate the field twice; first forwards by a distance $z_1$, then backwards by $-z_2$ such that the overall propagation distance is $z=z_1-z_2$, but realizing that this is necessary, and that this (or any other) particular solution is applicable is non-trivial.</p>\n\n<p>Now what if your input field is significantly tilted (i.e. it isn't propagating parallel to the z-axis)? You will want your computation grid to include the output field, but most of the energy may be located far from the origin of the $(x,y)$ coordinate system. You could make your grid large enough to accommodate this, but ideally you'd compute an off-axis chunk of the output plane. Once again you need a new algorithm!</p>\n\n<p>Consider that in general some people may have a need to propagate complicated optical fields to non-parallel planes or curved surfaces, to change the grid spacing in the output plane, or whatever other complication you can image, and you will begin to see how much decision making and complexity can be involved in selecting a propagation algorithm. Doing this in an automated way isn't necessarily impossible, but it is <strong>very</strong> difficult, and there is simply nobody who has undertaken the task of writing an open source library for this. I suspect such code exists in proprietary software packages, like CodeV or other lens design software, but remember that for a library to be developed there has to be somebody who is simultaneously interested (or paid sufficiently), qualified, and has the time to produce such a thing. Also remember that the audience for it would be limited to optical engineers and researchers, so there is little reward.</p>\n"

However, this turns out to be a special case that only holds for particles moving with speeds much less than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span>, the speed of light.

In fact, a photon can interact directly with any particle that has charge.  In the case of your solar sail, this means that on a microscopic level, each photon interacts with an electron (or a proton) in the sail material, imparting some momentum to it.  That electron (or proton) is then displaced from its equilibrium location, exerting a force on the rest of its neighbors, causing them to move in the direction of the original photon;  which then causes some momentum transfer to the neighbors' neighbors, and so on.</p>\n"

All particles affect each other at the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">absolute time</a> in an <a href=\"http://www.exactlywhatistime.com/physics-of-time/absolute-time/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">absolute space</a> in this Universe (this is, of course not our real Universe, but it just serves to investigate the Nature of cause and effect; besides, in <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/171299/acceleration-to-lightspeed-using-gravity\">this question</a> a similar kind of Universe is used).  </p>\n\n<p>Now when all particles affect each other simultaneously this means they will also affect <strong>themselves</strong> simultaneously and these in return backfire simultaneously to all other particles which again simultaneously backfire to all particles etc. So a particle, <strong>if</strong> it moves, has an instantaneously effect on its own movement by the instantaneous backfiring of all other particles, and this holds for all particles. Aren't the particles \"frozen\" somehow (this is an intuitive feeling on which I can't put my finger exactly)? Can the particles move at all if this is the case and cause and effect can't be separated? If not then a finite speed of light is necessary. </p>\n\n<p>This question differs from the possible duplicate because I ask the question of what will happen in this Universe (which is non-quantum mechanical, contrary to the possible duplicate) when cause and effect are non-separable and all particles interact simultaneously. What effect will this have on the movements (<strong>if</strong> they are able to move at all) on the particles? </p>\n\n<p>Let's boil down the problem to two charged elementary particles present in this imaginary Universe. What will happen? It seems to me that because of the non-separability of cause and effect, a problem arises because the particles don't \"know\" what to do. Both particles can't \"decide\" if they are the cause or the effect, ending up in no movement at all. </p>\n\n<p>So the crux is not being there a distinction between cause and effect.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

It's that way now except that they're trailing off in time. Since they would be instant, if you knew the exact state of everything at one time then you would know as much as could be known, while to do that in our world you'd have to know the entire history of the universe to get that far.</p>\n\n<p>Acceleration would work the same. a=F/m  Even though the force is instant, it still takes time for things to move. So the parts of Maxwell's equations that depend on position and velocity would be the same.</p>\n\n<p>The parts that depend on acceleration would be different. Because with everything instantaneously accelerating everything else, the numbers would come out different. One charge's acceleration instantly affects the amount and direction of force it puts onto everything else. If their acceleration is different that instantly affects the amount and direction of force they put on the first charge.</p>\n\n<p>That would make it harder for us to compute all that. It probably doesn't mean things blow up in an infinite feedback. Nature would find its balance. At each instant every charge would be getting the force from everything else that gets it to contribute precisely the right force onto everything else. It would just be tedious for us to do the math.</p>\n"

The reason why $c^2$ appears here is because we use incompatible units for lengths and time intervals and then the formulas will have to compensate for our bad habits. The meaning of $E = m c^2$ is made visible much better in natural units where $c = 1$; obviously $E = m$ conveys far more clearly that mass and rest energy are one and the same thing (so, it's not that energy can be converted to mass or vice versa).</p>\n\n<p>So, back to the mass of the elements, an atom has a total energy relative to the vacuum when that atom is not present, that energy difference is the mass of the atom.

Of course there’s no real reason why that should be forbidden, but if you allow it in the theory you get a divergence of interactions and the model breaks down.

        "golden_answer": " <p>Actually, what you've read about the production of nuclei is not quite correct. There are several <em>different</em> processes by which atomic nuclei are produced: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis\">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a> is the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form heavier elements in the early stages of the universe, as it cooled from the big bang. There are rather specific thermal requirements for this process to occur, so there was only a short time window in which heavier elements could form, meaning that the only fusion to actually happen in significant amounts was the conversion of hydrogen (and deuterium) to helium, and an <em>extremely</em> tiny amount of lithium.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis\">Stellar nucleosynthesis</a> is the fusion of hydrogen and other nuclei in the cores of stars. This is something separate from big bang cosmology, since stars didn't form until millions of years into the universe's lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>Now, contrary to what you might have read, not <em>all</em> elements are formed in stellar nucleosynthesis. There are specific \"chains\" of nuclear reactions that occur, and only the elements that are produced by those reactions will exist in a star in appreciable quantities. Most stars produce their energy using either the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction\">proton-proton chain</a> (in lighter stars) or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle\">CNO cycle</a> (in heavier stars), both of which consume hydrogen and form helium. Once most of the hydrogen has been consumed, the star's temperature will increase and it will start to fuse helium into carbon. When the helium runs out, it will fuse carbon into oxygen, then oxygen into silicon, then silicon into iron. (Of course the actual process is more complicated - see the Wikipedia articles for details.) Several other elements are produced or involved along the way, including neon, magnesium, phosphorous, and others, but lithium is not among them. In fact, stars have a tendency to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_burning\"><em>consume</em> lithium</a>, rather than producing it, so stars actually tend to have only small amounts of lithium.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis\">Supernova nucleosynthesis</a> is the fusion of atomic nuclei due to the high-pressure, high-energy conditions that arise when a large star explodes in a type II supernova. There are certain similarities between this and big bang nucleosynthesis, namely the high temperatures and pressures, but the main difference is that an exploding star will have \"reserves\" of heavy elements built up from a lifetime of nuclear fusion. So instead of just forming a lot of helium as occurred just after the big bang, a supernova will form a whole spectrum of heavy elements. In fact supernovae are the only natural source of elements heavier than iron, since it actually requires an input of energy to produce those elements as fusion products. I believe some amount of lithium would be formed in a supernova along with all the other elements, but since a large star would have used up its hydrogen and helium in the central region where most of the action takes place, lithium is probably not a particularly common reaction product.</p></li>\n</ol>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>Any symmetry of the local hidden variable polytope must map a vertex of the polytope to another other vertex (or trivially to itself). This is true in general by convexity. By the duality between vertex representation and facet representation we only need consider vertices. I have modified the way you write vertices to obtain $p(r_{1} r_{2} ... r_{N}|s_{1} s_{2} ... s_{N})=\\delta^{r_{1}}_{f_{1}(s_{1})}\\delta^{r_{2}}_{f_{1}(s_{2})}...\\delta^{r_{N}}_{f_{N}(s_{N})}$ where $f_{j}(s_{j})$ is the image of $s_{j}$ under a single-site function $f_{j}:\\mathbb{Z}_{m_{j}}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{v_{j}}$.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a symmetry will map from the product of single-site maps $\\delta^{r_{1}}_{f_{1}(s_{1})}\\delta^{r_{2}}_{f_{1}(s_{2})}...\\delta^{r_{N}}_{f_{N}(s_{N})}$ to other products of single-site maps $\\delta^{r_{1}}_{f&#39;_{1}(s_{1})}\\delta^{r_{2}}_{f&#39;_{1}(s_{2})}...\\delta^{r_{N}}_{f&#39;_{N}(s_{N})}$ with $f_{j}$ not necessarily equal to $f&#39;_{j}$. Of course, one can reorder the products by permuting the parties and still produce a product of delta functions. Locality prevents us from allowing delta functions of the form $\\delta^{r_{j}}_{f_{j&#39;}(s_{j&#39;})}$ with $j\\neq j&#39;$. Therefore, other than permutations the only symmetry transformations that are allowed will be transformations on the maps $f_{j}(s_{j})\\rightarrow f&#39;_{j}(s_{j})$.</p>\n\n<p>We only need to consider each site's marginal probability distribution $p(r_{j}|s_{j})$ which can be written as a $m_{j}v_{j}$ length real vector. The vertices have $m_{j}$ non-zero elements which have unity value for each value of $s_{j}$. In order to conserve these two conditions of the vertex probability distributions, the only allowed transformations on the real vectors that are allowed are a restricted class of permutations of row elements.

Now, ask what happens when you act with $\\hat L$ on the right hand side of the displayed equation above.</p>\n\n<p>By the Leibniz rule, there are the terms with $\\hat L \\psi = 0$. It vanishes by the equations of motion. But there are extra terms where $\\hat L$ acts on the step functions.</p>\n\n<p>The operator $\\hat L$ contains the term that differentiates with respect to $t_1$ multiplied by a coefficient $C$. This turns $\\theta(t_1-t_2)$ to $\\delta(t_1-t_2)$. The same occurs in the next term, but with the opposite sign which cancels the sign that was already there. So the extra terms are\n$$ \\hat L T(\\psi \\psi^\\dagger) = C\\delta(t_1-t_2) (\\psi \\psi^\\dagger + \\psi^\\dagger \\psi)$$\nI got two terms because there were two terms. However, these two terms exactly combine to the anticommutator of $\\psi$ and $\\psi^\\dagger$ which only needs to be evaluated for $t_1=t_2$, the equal-time anticommutator, and the result is $D\\cdot \\delta(x_1-x_2)$.</p>\n\n<p>That's why the action of $\\hat L$ on the correlator ends up being $CD\\delta(t_1-t_2)\\delta(x_1-x_2)$ where the constants $C,D$ are mostly just factors of $i$ etc.</p>\n\n<p>For bosonic fields, $\\hat L$ has the second derivative with respect to time. One of the derivatives has the fate as above, the other one turns the other $\\phi$, which plays the role of $\\psi^\\dagger$, into $\\partial_t \\phi$ which is the canonical momentum, and it's the right variable that has the $\\delta$-function-like commutator. Also, the intermediate sign is the opposite one but the result is the same, some $CD\\cdot\\delta\\cdot\\delta$.</p>\n"

Please keep this in mind when reading this question and framing answers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Today I observed a gecko on a ceiling and began wondering how it managed to stay put. A <a href=\"http://www.physics.org/facts/gecko-really.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit of googling</a> revealed that the magic is actually van der Waals forces, not an unusually high coefficient of static friction or something.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried to draw a mental free body diagram of a gecko at rest on the ceiling. I drew a downwards arrow representing the gravitational force, and an upwards arrow for the van der Waals force. And then I wondered -- is that it? Is the van der Waals force upwards equal to the downwards force of gravity?</p>\n\n<p>When I studied physics at university, we always drew a normal force perpendicular to the surface the object in question was resting on. We were told this represented the force exerted \"upwards\" by the surface to counteract gravity. By doing this we could calculate the magnitude of an unknown force by having the normal counteract gravity.</p>\n\n<p>In my gecko situation, my unknown force is acting counter to gravity. Is there a normal force at play here too? Or is the van der Waals force taking its place?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>Firstly, the 'normal' force is a contact force which opposes two surfaces being forced together.  It is not caused by gravity, but it can be the response to gravity (eg when gravity pushes a book into contact with a table).  It is caused by inter-molecular repulsive forces.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the van der Waals force is an attractive force.  This is the only upward force here, pulling the gecko towards the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>However, does this mean that the pads on the gecko's feet are so finely controlled that the van der Waals force exactly balances the weight of the gecko?  ie If the gecko has a larger breakfast than usual the pads somehow exert a stronger van der Waals force to compensate?  I am not sure this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the gecko can control the van der Waals force, I doubt that it can be done so precisely.  I think it more likely that the van der Waals attractive force is always slightly greater than gravity, pulling the gecko into the ceiling.  The usual repulsive inter-molecular forces then come into play to oppose the net upward force on the gecko. The normal contact force is reactive and adjusts to provide a perfect balance of forces.</p>\n\n<p>So in addition to its weight (downward) and the van der Waals force of attraction from the ceiling (upward) I think there is also a small additional 'normal' (in both meanings of the word!) contact force from the ceiling acting downward on the gecko.  This is where I disagree with Harm Moolenaar. (I do not understand what Joce is saying - possibly the same as Harm?)</p>\n\n<p>To some extent the issue might be one of semantics - ie whether 'van der Waals force' includes the inter-molecular repulsion or is separate from it.  Nature does not distinguish one force from another, only we do that, for our own convenience.  So I think it is an issue of how forces are distinguished and classified.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>The RG describes how a QFT changes under an overall change of scale -- loosely speaking, as we \"zoom in\" or \"zoom out\". Fixed points of the RG are scale-invariant QFTs: they look the same at all scales. If you start with some generic QFT and follow the RG flow to its low- or high-resolution limit, the usual expectation is that it approaches a scale-invariant QFT (if the limit is defined at all).</p>\n\n<p>Many different QFTs may flow to the same fixed point, so we can think of the scale-invariant QFTs as unifying landmarks in the landscape of all QFTs. This is what <strong>universality</strong> is about. (This is also closely related to why <strong>renormalizable</strong> QFTs are often sufficient in applications. Roughly speaking, at low enough resolution, any QFT looks the same as a renormalizable one, even if we don't go all the way to the fixed point.) Knowing what scale-invariant QFTs lie at the low- and high-resolution endpoints of a given RG flow can tell us a lot about the QFTs that lie along intermediate points on that flow. Conversely, one way to approach the study of QFT is to start with a scale-invariant QFT and perturb it in different ways, which is like taking little steps out into the various RG flows that go to/from that particular fixed point in various directions. </p>\n\n<p>The study of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics, like the critical point that terminates the liquid-vapor phase transition of a typical fluid, uses the same ideas.

If there is charge outside $V$ its contribution to the flux will cancel out. </p>\n\n<p>This means that it does not matter if there is charge outside $V$, the only field that is taken into consideration is the one generated by the charge inside. To make this clear, we can write $\\vec E = \\vec E_{out} + \\vec E_{in}$ where $\\vec E_{out}$ is the field that does not contribute to the total flux through $\\partial V$ and $\\vec E_{in}$ is the one generated by the charge inside $V$.

In fact, on the curve where the charge distribution intersects the surface, $|\\vec E|\\rightarrow\\infty$ so not a very easy to analyse scenario. </p>\n\n<p>Now in all the cases I have seen, this problem of integration and divergence of the field is not mentioned because the authors use the perpendicular electric field and everything is solved within 3-4 lines.

In case 2, the surface defined by the charge distribution intersects the cylinder surface, thus resulting a curve $\\Gamma$. The field around $\\Gamma$ goes to $\\infty$. If I want to compute the flux in this case the integral wouldn't converge. But this is if I try to compute the flux. On the other hand, the charge is finite. How does this happen?</p>\n\n<p>There is no need to say that for the infinite plane these problems do not appear.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my problem to which I tried to answer and asked if the reasoning is ok.

Its whole life consists of just these two events, two &quot;instants&quot; if you will - the &quot;travel&quot; is really just the delay between those two occurrences with regard to everyone else. Two instants, each of zero duration, comprise zero time: <span class=\"math-container\">$0 \\cdot 2 = 0$</span>.</p>\n<p>Because of this, it doesn't have the <em>capability</em> to define an &quot;experience&quot; that is anything more than those two events - and thus you cannot ascribe to it a &quot;view&quot; of the Universe. This is <em>why</em>, in a sense, you cannot define a reference frame for a photon that &quot;makes sense&quot;, as you're running into. The &quot;world view&quot; is &quot;I get emitted, I get absorbed&quot;. Boom. That's it.</p>\n<p>Another thing that is often missed is that &quot;reference frames&quot; do not exist as an entity in their own apart from spacetime and its contents. What they are, instead, are just systems of coordinates, that is, ways of labelling events i.e. points in spacetime, and in that case are wholly arbitrary. The Lorentz frames in special relativity are arbitrary - what is not is the <em>Lorentz symmetries</em> that relate them, which are self-maps of the points on spacetime as points regardless of labels, and the fact that the <em>dynamics</em>, the physics, on that spacetime, respect those symmetries, meaning that if we want to describe a moving observer's view of the world, we can do so without altering the form of the equations we were already using - which is how you can talk <em>hypothetically</em> of a Lorentz symmetry violation without it tripping over itself in a contradiction. (Note that you can always create a &quot;moving reference frame&quot; in <em>any</em> sort of universe that has a notion of space and time, <em>but</em> it may be that you need to use different &quot;physics&quot; to talk about this: toy example is Conway's Game of Life. Its rules are <em>not</em> motionally symmetric in any way.)</p>\n<p>And to link that back to the idea of &quot;experience&quot;, any &quot;way of experiencing&quot; spacetime can be related to some coordinate system. In fact, the Lorentz frame is <em>not</em> any human's experience of spacetime: instead, what you want is a &quot;light cone frame&quot; where the &quot;present&quot; is taken as one's <em>past light cone</em>. The Lorentz <em>symmetry</em> still relates it to the moving case, but the coordinates are all different and the symmetry takes a different form. (Whose experience is it? Well, because its &quot;present&quot; involves knowledge of spacelike-separated events, a <em>patch</em> of it can only be seen by an observer well into the future of the happenings in question, that has reconstructed the view from suitable observations.)</p>\n<p>Hence, the failure of the Lorentz transformation to meaningfully define a frame means that the situation in the case of a photon is <em>fundamentally different</em> from the situation in case of everyone else, and its experience is likewise different.</p>\n"

I'm confident, however, that a similar special-relativistic answer can be constructed.</p>\n\n<p>The following theorem essentially says that if even just Newton's First Law is required to be preserved in the transformation between friends, then the frames must be related by a Galilean transformation, so they must be in the same equivalence class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let a twice-differentiable, orientation preserving, time-dependent Euclidean isometry $T:\\mathbb R\\to \\mathrm{ISO}(3)$ be given, and let $t_0$ be a real number.  If the spacetime transformation\n\\begin{align}\n  G(t,\\mathbf x) = (t+t_0, T(t)(\\mathbf x))\n\\end{align}\npreserves Newton's First Law, then $G$ is Galilean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Proof.</strong>  $T(t)$ can be written as a time-dependent rotation plus a time-dependent translation:\n\\begin{align}\n    T(t)(\\mathbf x) = R(t)\\mathbf x + \\mathbf c(t).\n\\end{align}\nTherefore, under the action of $G$, a straight line $\\mathbf x_0 + t\\mathbf v_0$ gets mapped into the following curve:\n\\begin{align}\n    R(t)(\\mathbf x_0 + (t+t_0)\\mathbf v_0) + \\mathbf c(t)\n\\end{align}\nIf $G$ preserves Newton's First Law, then this transformed curve must have zero acceleration no matter which $\\mathbf x_0$ and $\\mathbf v_0$ we choose.  Thus,\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \\big[R(t)(\\mathbf x_0 + (t+t_0)\\mathbf v_0) + \\mathbf c(t)\\big] = \\mathbf 0,\n\\end{align}\n<em>for all</em> $\\mathbf x_0,\\mathbf v_0\\in\\mathbb R^3$.  Distributing the derivatives on the left hand side gives\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ddot R(t) \\mathbf x_0 + \\ddot R(t) (t+t_0)\\mathbf v_0 + 2\\dot R(t) \\mathbf v_0 + \\ddot{\\mathbf c}(t) = \\mathbf 0\n\\end{align}\nChoosing $\\mathbf x_0 = \\mathbf v_0 = \\mathbf 0$ gives $\\ddot{\\mathbf c}(t) = 0$ which implies that there exist constant vectors $\\mathbf c$ and $\\mathbf v$ such that $\\mathbf c(t) = \\mathbf c + t \\mathbf v$.  Using this gives the reduced constraint\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ddot R(t) \\mathbf x_0 + \\ddot R(t) (t+t_0)\\mathbf v_0 + 2\\dot R(t) \\mathbf v_0 = \\mathbf 0.\n\\end{align}\nNow, picking $\\mathbf v_0 = \\mathbf 0$ gives $\\ddot R(t) \\mathbf x_0 = \\mathbf 0$ for all $\\mathbf x_0$, and this in turn means that $\\ddot R(t) = 0$.  Using this further reduces to\n\\begin{align}\n    \\dot R(t)\\mathbf v_0 = \\mathbf 0\n\\end{align}\nfor all $\\mathbf v_0$, and this implies that $\\dot R(t) = 0$.  This means that there is a constant rotation $R$ such that $R(t) = R$.  Putting this all together, we find that our original isometry $T(t)$ takes the following form:\n\\begin{align}\n    T(t) = R\\mathbf x + \\mathbf c + t\\mathbf v\n\\end{align}\nand hence $G$ is Galilean, namely it consists only of a time translation, a constant spatial translation, a Galilean boost by constant velocity, and a constant rotation. $\\blacksquare$.</p>\n"

The principle is actually one of <strong>stationary action</strong>, or action which is unchanged by small path-perturbations which leave the beginning and end points fixed. Valid trajectories can also be realized by <em>maximal</em>-action paths or <em>saddle-point</em> paths, in principle.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, if we have a light bulb over here and an omnidirectional detector over there, we will see that the biggest contribution is from light going straight from the bulb to the detector. However, there can be other contributions too, say, if there is a mirror nearby. Light doesn't just take the path of least-time, full-stop: there is now also a path which takes a little longer (to hit the mirror and reflect back to the detector) which also contributes. If the light is particularly coherent you might even be able to arrange for the light going those two different paths to destructively interfere at the detector with some other half-silvered mirrors etc.</p>\n\n<p>Nature chooses the paths where little vibrations around the path do not affect the action-integral. You can view this as the action integral being sensitive to little quantum perturbations of the trajectories and classical-Nature preferring only those trajectories where the action is insensitive. In QED this happens because the particle has an associated wave-phase, called collectively the \"amplitude\" of detecting the particle, which requires constructive interference of a lot of \"nearby\" paths in order to build up to any substantial sum. The action turns out to just be the phase of the wave, so we need an \"unperturbed action\" to get \"the same phase\" to get \"all the nearby paths constructively interfere to generate a big probability.\"</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, you can imagine that at the microscopic level there is a lot of \"jiggle\" and Nature abhors such \"jiggle\" at the macroscopic level of action-principles, and then you have some \"thriftiness\" of Nature with respect to action-jiggle. But you cannot just say that Nature abhors spending any more action than it has to, because just as with the least-time principle not being 100% right when there are two locally-least paths, the least-action principle will also be violated when there are two locally-least paths.

The equipartition theorem is also known as the law of equipartition,equipartition of energy, or simply equipartition. The original idea of equipartition was that, in thermal equilibrium, energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in the translational motion of a molecule should equal that of its rotational motions.</p>\n<p>Although the equipartition theorem makes very accurate predictions in certain conditions, it becomes inaccurate when quantum effects are significant, such as at low temperatures. When the thermal energy kBT is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular degree of freedom, the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be &quot;frozen out&quot; when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model black-body radiation</strong> —also known as the ultraviolet catastrophe—led Max Planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.</p>\n<p>However, this answer <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65264/leap-from-photon-gas-energy-distribution-to-black-body-radiation?rq=1\">Black Body Radiation</a> might have an answer that makes more sense to you.</p>\n"

If the system has only kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$, then the total energy is of course $E = K + U$, where $E &lt; 0$ for bound systems. In virial equilibrium where the potential energy is purely gravitational, then we also have $K = -U/2$. As a result, $K = -E$, and so adding more energy results in a decrease in temperature.</p>\n\n<p>Examples include stars and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\" rel=\"noreferrer\">globular clusters</a>. Imagine adding energy to such systems by heating up the particles in the star or giving the stars in a cluster more kinetic energy. The extra motion will work toward slightly unbinding the system, and everything will spread out. But since (negative) potential energy counts twice as much as kinetic energy in the energy budget, everything will be moving even slower in this new configuration once equilibrium is reattained.</p>\n\n<p>At some level, this all comes down to what you're defining as temperature. Recall that temperature simply accounts for the flow of heat into whatever you've defined as your thermometer. If your thermometer couples to translational kinetic energy but not to gravitational potential energy, then you get the situation above.</p>\n\n<p>I'll leave it to someone else to answer in terms of solid materials or inverted populations.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>Let us deal with this on two parts: (1) How do you take the curl?</p>\n\n<p>The E-field you describe has the form ${\\bf E} = E_0 \\sin (kz-\\omega t)\\, {\\bf i}$, where the latter unit vector assumes the wave is polarised along the x-axis, while the wave travels along the z-axis.

A field with a non-zero curl will make the paddle wheel turn and the axis of rotation points in the direction of the curl.</p>\n\n<p>If I assume that the MATLAB plot you show has z along the horizontal axis, then you can imagine the E-field as vertical arrows of size proportional to the E-field strength at that instant in time. Imagine placing a paddle wheel at some point along the axis. In general, the E-field on one side of the wheel will be of a different strength to the E-field on the other side of the wheel and hence it will rotate around an axis perpendicular to z. If we then roll the clock forward to some later instant of time, the situation could reverse with the E-field now stronger on the other side and the wheel rotates in the opposite direction - i.e. a cosinusoidally varying curl in a direction perpendicular to the wave motion and perpendicular to the E-field.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an attempt to show this.

        "golden_answer": " <p>There are (at least) two effects to consider:</p>\n\n<p>First - a point source of sound in free space (air on all sides) and that emits power isotropically (in all directions) will see power diminish with distance (since the \"sphere\" of sound gets bigger, the sound at any one point on that sphere must have less energy). This results in a decrease of 6 dB every time you double the distance. Since most sound sources are neither isotropic, nor point sources, you usually can start using this approximation once you are \"far\" compared to the size of the source (loudspeaker, for example). So if you have a 20 cm diameter speaker, you can say that if the sound level is 66 dB at 4 m, it will be 60 dB at 8 m and 54 dB at 16 m. But you can't say that it will be 84 dB at 50 cm - you are getting \"close compared to the size of the source\". </p>\n\n<p>Second - attenuation of individual frequencies due to attenuation. This is much more complex; I described some of the factors in <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/134791/26969\">this earlier answer</a>, which shows that the attenuation of sound in air is a function of temperature, humidity, and frequency - among other factors. As a rule of thumb, higher frequencies will be attenuated more strongly. And that effect is linear with distance: if you have a 3 dB attenuation per 10 m, you will have 30 dB over 100 m. In that way it is different than the inverse square relationship, which becomes less significant as you move further away (since you have to move much further to double the distance again).</p>\n\n<p>Another way to think about that: as long as the wave front looks like a sphere, the inverse square law is very important; but once the wave front starts to look like a plane wave, linear attenuation becomes the driving factor.</p>\n"

Basically for these types of PDEs a set of initial data doesn't uniquely determine the evolution of the system and any particular solution, like the planetary orbits in the Solar System, wouldn't be stable (and without a stable Solar System we wouldn't be here :-).

        "golden_answer": " <p><em>1) What can be say about the work done by the man to the weight?</em></p>\n\n<p>Unlike gravity, the force exerted by the man is in general not constant, does not depend only on position of the body (you may apply different force on the weight at the same height $h$ on the way up vs. on the way down), and is not conservative (does not arise from a potential). When the force is conservative, like gravity, you can conclude that its work is $0$ when the body returns to the initial place. This is because the work of such a force measures the change in potential energy, like $mgh$ for gravity. But the force exerted by the man doesn't arise from any useful notion of potential energy and you cannot conclude that its work equals $0$ <em>just because</em> the weight returns to the same place.</p>\n\n<p><em>2) Can it be equal in absolute value to the work made by the gravitational force (that is $0$)?</em></p>\n\n<p>Despite what I wrote above, we can conclude that the work done by the man is $0$, but only if the weight, on return to its initial location, has the same speed as in the beginning (that is, $0$). This is true for the following reason. The work of the <em>resultant</em> force acting on the body (the sum of all forces) always equals the change in kinetic energy. If the kinetic energy didn't change, then the <em>total</em> work is $0$. The total work is the sum of the work by gravity and by the man. The work by gravity is $0$ for a different reason, as explained above (gravity is conservative). So the work by the man must be $0$ too.</p>\n\n<p>So if the man carefully brings the weight to the ground, letting it touch the ground gently and settle, the work will be zero. If he throws the weight down or lets it fall, or moves it violently, the work done by the man will not be $0$. It will be equal to the weight's kinetic energy, $mv^2/2$, at the moment of impact with the ground.</p>\n\n<p><em>3) Is it actually equal to the amount of physical energy spent by the man for this physical performance?</em></p>\n\n<p>No. Our bodies are built from soft tissues, and even the strong parts, the bones, are connected by tissues that cannot withstand large forces passively and still maintain the amount of control we desire.

If this contracting/relaxing was purely mechanical, it might do just a little work (not $0$ because some kinetic energy will be lost to friction, but almost).

        "golden_answer": " <p>I think there are two quite separate points to make in response to your question.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that the speed of light is only locally constant. This means if you measure the speed of light at your position you will find it's always a bit under $3 \\times 10^8$ m/sec. However if you measure the speed of light at some distance away from you the speed you measure may be different. The classic example of this is a black hole. If a light ray passes you on it's way towards a black hole you'll measure the velocity as it passes you to be $c$. However as the light approaches the black hole you'll see (I'm using the word <em>see</em> loosely here!) the light slow down as it approaches the event horizon. If you waited an infinite time you would see the light actually come to a stop at the event horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Effects like this arise whenever spacetime is curved. The speed of light is only guaranteed to be $c$ when spacetime is flat. The reason a local measurement of the speed always returns the result $c$ is because spacetime in your vicinity always looks flat if you look at a small enough area around you. The usual analogy for this is that the surface of the Earth looks flat around you if you only look a few metres, but look further and you'll know it's curved because you can see the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this is a bit of a diversion, but you ask:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We know that light is noticeably bent by massive bodies, I guess it is also slightly bent by any kind of energy in its proximity, even other light (or am I wrong).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You aren't wrong. We normally think of gravity, i.e. spacetime curvature, being caused by matter, but actually it's caused by an object called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor\" rel=\"nofollow\">stress-energy tensor</a>. Matter does contribute to this, but so does energy and even surprising things like pressure. So light is bent by energy, but because energy and mass are related by Einstein's famous equation $E = mc^2$ it takes a lot of energy to have the same effect as a small amount of matter.</p>\n\n<p>But back to the speed of light and the second point.</p>\n\n<p>Light is an electromagnetic field and it interacts with any charged particles it encounters. Mainly it interacts with electrons because electrons are relatively light; it does interact with atomic nuclei as well but the interaction is inversely proportional to the mass of the charged particle, and nuclei are so heavy that (for visible light) it's only the electrons that interact significantly.</p>\n\n<p>When light encounters an electron it makes the electron oscillate and transfers energy to it, but the electron re-emits the energy and the light travels on unchanged. Be a bit careful trying to make a mental image of this. The light doesn't get absorbed, wait a bit, then get re-emitted - life is more complicated than this. The electromagnetic wave and the electron form a composite system and the resulting mixture has a velocity of less than $c$ i.e. in the presence of electrons light travels more slowly. Sadly I don't know of a simple analogy for this process.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, the reason that the refractive index of say glass is greater than one is because it contains lots of electrons for the light to interact with. This interaction slows the light and increases the refractive index. The point of all this is that whenever there are electrons about the speed of light will be less than $c$.</p>\n\n<p>So to summarise: the speed of light is only $c$ when it's travelling in a (locally) flat spacetime and there are no electrons (or other charged particles) about. This is pretty close to what you have in your bell jar, so yes it is the kind of vacuum you get in your bell jar. True, spacetime is a bit curved in the bell jar because it's in the Earth's gravitational field, but the bell jar is small enough that the spacetime it encloses is almost flat. It's also true that your bell jar contains more stray gas molecules than say intergalactic space, but with a decent vacuum the density of gas molecules (and the electrons they contain) is so low it makes little difference to the speed of the light.</p>\n\n<p>I get the impression you were hoping a vacuum (at least as far as the speed of light is concerned) would be something more special than just pumping out a bell jar, but it isn't. I hope I haven't disappointed you!</p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>This is a question I've been mulling over for a while and I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Sorry if it's a bit of a novice question. For the record, I don't fully know GR, but don't let that stop you from using it in the answer.</p>\n\n<p>Since the universe is expanding - that is, the spacetime metric is expanding by way of a near-exponentially increasing scale factor - we can say that the distance between any two non-bound objects is increasing over time. Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)? Since there was no initial relative velocities, wouldn't the two objects return to being in the same inertial frame? And seeing as none of them experienced any sort of acceleration, how then could we describe their two final states? By which I mean, if we were to assume there were relativistic effects during transit, how would we overcome such simple paradoxes like the twin paradox, or other relevant ones?</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm stumped. I even attended a lecture by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Alcubierre\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miguel Alcubierre</a> since he would have had to consider these types of effects in his design...

Accelerations are just a <em>measure</em> of how rapidly velocities are changing.</p>\n\n<p>What you're running into here is the fact that general relativity doesn't have any notion of how to measure the motion of object A relative to a distant object B. It is neither true nor false that A and B gain relative velocity due to cosmological expansion. It is neither true nor false that A and B have nonzero accelerations relative to one another. Frames of reference in GR are local, not global. It's valid to say that distant galaxies are moving away from us at some velocity. It's also valid to say that everything is standing still, but the space between us and the distant galaxy is expanding.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kinematic time dilation is well defined in SR, which means that in GR it's only defined locally. Gravitational time dilation is only well defined in GR in the case of a static spacetime, but cosmological spacetimes aren't static. So it is neither true nor false that there is time dilation between us and a distant galaxy. Concretely, you could measure Doppler shifts. If you feel like interpreting these shifts in purely kinematic terms, you can assign a velocity to the distant galaxy relative to us. But this is not mandatory and actually doesn't really work very well, in the sense that the velocity you get is usually several times smaller than the rate at which the proper distance between the galaxies is increasing. (Proper distance is defined as the distance you would measure with a chain of rulers, each at rest relative to the CMB, at a moment in time defined according to a notion of simultaneity defined by cosmological conditions such as the temperature of the CMB.) In particular, there are galaxies that we can observe that are now and always have been receding from us at $v&gt;c$, if you define $v$ as the rate of change of proper distance. The fact that we can observe them tells us that their Doppler shifts are finite and correspond to $v&lt;c$.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a nice popular-level article that explains a lot of this kind of stuff:</p>\n\n<p>Davis and Lineweaver, \"Misconceptions about the Big Bang,\" <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=misconceptions-about-the-2005-03\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=misconceptions-about-the-2005-03</a></p>\n\n<p>It's paywalled, but there are lots of copyright-violating copies floating around on the web.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a presentation of the same material at a higher level:</p>\n\n<p>Davis and Lineweaver, \"Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe,\" <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808</a></p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>An easy way to prove Ohm's law for electric fields that aren't constant is to first assume that the electric field is approximately constant over short lengths, just like $E=dV/dL$ suggests. Using that, you can derive Ohm's law for short lengths of material, $dV=IdR$. We'll assume that \"current in = current out\", which is true at steady-state. This allows us to integrate this equation (since current is a constant relative to both dV and dR), and you get regular Ohm's law $V=IR$. This is equivalent to saying that small resistances combine in series to form a net resistance for a material, for which Ohm's law also holds.

This means that about 10,000 lux is in the UV spectrum</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is incorrect reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>First, even if the sun emits 10% of its energy in UV, much of this UV is filtered out in the ozone layer and atmosphere, and does not reach the ground. So the fraction of UV in solar radiation at the ground is much lower.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the unit <em>lux</em> measures luminous emittance, meaning how bright a source appears to the human eye.</p>\n\n<p>The 10% of the sun's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_flux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">radiant flux</a> that falls in the UV does not contribute (much) to its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_flux\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">luminous flux</a> because the human eye does not see it. </p>\n\n<p>In order for a UV source to produce 10,000 lux of illumination, it would have to be so high-powered that it looks as bright as ordinary daylight. This would be very powerful indeed, because our eyes do not detect UV radiation very strongly at all. </p>\n\n<p>Very likely this source would produce burns immediately if human skin were exposed to it.

The statement that sunlight is 3% ultraviolet is referring to radiant energy, not illuminance. That is, it is saying 3% of the energy received from the sun is in the UV. That does not mean that UV is responsible for 3% of the illumination perceived by our eyes. </p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>Great question that exposes some really confusing terminology.  This is a rather long answer, and the punchline is basically in the second-to-last paragraph, but I think (hope) it's worthwhile to read the whole answer because I tried to give a somewhat systematic description of fermionic states using a specific, simple example along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, let's use Dirac notation; it makes things a bit more clear in my opinion.  Let's also restrict the initial discussion to the spin states of two spin-$1/2$ particles (which are therefore fermions) so that the Hilbert space for the state of each particle is two-dimensional.</p>\n\n<p>The Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_{1/2}$ for a single spin-$1/2$ particle is spanned by the vectors $|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle$ corresponding to the spin being \"up\" and \"down\" respectively.  The Hilbert space for the composite system of two distinguishable spin $1/2$ particles is the tensor product $\\mathcal H=\\mathcal H_{1/2}\\otimes\\mathcal H_{1/2}$ of the the single spin $1/2$ Hilbert space with istelf.  This Hilbert space is four-dimensional and is spanned by the four states\n\\begin{align}\n  |+\\rangle|+\\rangle, \\qquad |+\\rangle|-\\rangle, \\qquad |-\\rangle|+\\rangle,\\qquad |-\\rangle|-\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nEvery state of the system is some linear combination of these four.  Now suppose, instead that the spins are identical, then it turns out that the physical Hilbert space of the system is no longer the tensor product; it is a <em>subspace</em> of the tensor product called the \"antisymmetric subspace\" which is defined as follows.  We define the <strong>exchange operator</strong> $P$ on $\\mathcal H$ as the unique linear operator with the following action on any tensor product basis state\n\\begin{align}\n  P|i\\rangle|j\\rangle = |j\\rangle|i\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nIn other words, the exchange operator just exchanges the two factors of any product state.  We say that a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ in the tensor product space is <strong>antisymmetric</strong> provided\n\\begin{align}\n  P|\\psi\\rangle = -|\\psi\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nThe <strong>antisymmetric subspace</strong> of $\\mathcal H$ is then defined as the set of all vectors that are antisymmetric.  We then have the following physical fact:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For a system consisting of two identical fermions, the state of the system must reside in the antisymmetric subspace of the tensor product of the single-particle Hilbert spaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now let's go back to the spin example to see what this means concretely.  An arbitrary state $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the two spin $1/2$ system can be written as\n\\begin{align}\n  |\\psi\\rangle = c_{++}|+\\rangle|+\\rangle + c_{+-}|+\\rangle|-\\rangle + c_{-+}|-\\rangle|+\\rangle + c_{--}|-\\rangle|-\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nThe exchance operator acting on this state gives\n\\begin{align}\n  P|\\psi\\rangle = c_{++}|+\\rangle|+\\rangle + c_{+-}|-\\rangle|+\\rangle + c_{-+}|+\\rangle|-\\rangle + c_{--}|-\\rangle|-\\rangle\n\\end{align}\nbut for identical fermions, the state must be antisymmetric, and this implies constraints on the coefficients\n\\begin{align}\n  c_{++} = 0, \\qquad c_{--} = 0, \\qquad c_{-+} = -c_{+-}\n\\end{align}\nso the most general (normalized) fermionic state for the system is\n\\begin{align}\n  |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle|-\\rangle - |-\\rangle|+\\rangle)\n\\end{align}\nWhen we say that the particles cannot occupy the same state, this is just another way of pointing out in this case that the coefficients of the states $|+\\rangle|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle|-\\rangle$ must vanish; these are states in which either both spins are \"up\" or both are \"down\".</p>\n\n<p>In particular, you say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>but it's still just one state -- occupied by two fermions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well certainly that's true since the (pure) state of any quantum mechanical system must be some vector in some Hilbert space.  The above example shows, however, that the \"same state\" terminology can be thought of in terms of the two tensor factors in the Hilbert space; namely the product basis vectors in which the single-particle states of both particles are the same should be excluded from the Hilbert space.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I have concentrated on low dimensional examples, the analysis goes through analogously for Hilbert spaces of any dimension; the Fermionic state are always just those in the antisymmetric subspace, so any product basis vectors in which both factors are the same should be excluded from the Hilbert space basis; such vectors do not live in the antisymmetric subspace.</p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>When finding the discrete energy states of a operator I have been taught to use the time-independent Schrodinger equation which restates the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. What I don’t understand is why the eigenvalues are the energy states, is there firstly a mathematical reason and secondly a physical reason?</p>\n\n<p>Does this arise from Hamiltonian or Lagrangian mechanics which I am not familiar with?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>As has been remarked by others and explained clearly, and mathematically, the eigenvalues are important because a) they allow you to solve the time-dependent equation, i.e., solve for the evolution of the system and b) a state which belongs to the eigenvalue $E$, i.e., as we say, a state which is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $E$, has an expectation value of the energy operator which is easy to see has to be $E$ itself.  But those explanations are advanced and rely on the maths.  And they do not explain why $E$ should be considered 'an energy level'. At some risk, I will try to answer your question more physically.</p>\n\n<p>What is the physical reason why the energy states of a system, e.g., an atom, are the eigenvalues of the operator $H$ that appears in the time-independent Schroedinger equation? Well, first, note that it's absolutely the same $H$ that appears in the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, $$H\\cdot \\psi = -i{\\partial \\psi \\over \\partial t}$$ which controls the rate of change of $\\psi$.</p>\n\n<p>The answer doesn't come from the classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian mechanics, but from the then-new quantum properties of Nature.  A non-classical feature of QM is that some states are <em>stationary</em>, which means they do not change in time.  E.g., the electron in a Bohr orbit is actually not moving, not orbiting at all, and this solves the classical paradoxes about the atom (why the rotating charge doesn't radiate its energy away and fall into the centre).  </p>\n\n<p>The first key point is that an eigenstate is a stationary state: what is the explanation for this? well, Schroedinger's time dependent equation clearly says that, up to a constant of proportionality, the time-rate of change of any state $\\psi$ is found by applying the operator $H$ (the Hamiltonian: we do not yet know it is also the energy operator) to it: the new vector or function $H\\cdot\\psi$ is the change in $\\psi$ per unit time.  Obviously if this is zero, $\\psi$ does not change (this was the only classical possibility).  But also if $H\\cdot\\psi$\nis even a non-zero multiple of $\\psi$, call it $E\\psi$, then $\\psi$ plus this rate of change is still a multiple of $\\psi$, so as time goes on, $\\psi$ changes in a trivial fashion: just to another multiple of itself.  In QM, a multiple of the wave function represents the <em>same</em> quantum state, so we see the quantum state does not change.</p>\n\n<p>Now the next key point is that a state with a definite energy value must be stationary.  Why? In QM, it is not automatic that a system has a definite value of a physical quantity, but if it does, that means its measurement always leads to the same answer, so there is no uncertainty.  So if there is no uncertainty in the energy, by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle there must be infinite uncertainty in something else, whatever is 'conjugate' to energy.  And that is time.  You cannot tell the time using this system, which implies it is not changing.  So it is stationary.\n(remember, we are not assuming that $H$ is also the energy operator and we are not assuming the formula for expectations).</p>\n\n<p>Thus being an eigenstate of $H$ implies $\\psi$ is stationary.  And having a definite energy value implies it is stationary.  Being physicists, we now conclude that being an eigenstate implies it has a definite energy value, which answers your question, and these are the 'energy levels' of a system such as an atom: a system, even an atom, might not possess a definite energy, but if it doesn't, it won't be stationary, and being microscopic, the time-scale in which it will evolve will be so rapid we are unlikely to be able to observe its energy, or even care (since it won't be relevant to molecules or chemistry).  So, 'most' atoms for which we can actually measure their energy must be stationary: this is 'why' the definite values of energy which a stationary state can possess are called the 'energy levels' of the system, and historically were discovered first, before Schroedingers equation.  From a human perspective, most atoms that we care about spend most of their time that matters to us in an approximately stationary state.  </p>\n\n<p>In case you are wondering why time is the conjugate to energy, whereas Heisenberg's original analysis of his uncertainty principle showed that position was conjugate to momentum, we rely on relativity: time is just another coordinate of space-time, and so is analogous to position.  And in relativistic mechanics, momentum in a spatial direction is analogous to energy (or mass, same thing).  In the standard relativistic equation $$p^2-m^2=E^2,$$ we see that momentum ($p$) and mass $m$ are symmetric (except for the negative sign) with each other. So since momentum is conjugate to position, $m$ or energy must be conjugate to time. For this reason, Bohr was able to extend Heisenberg's analysis, of the uncertainty relations between measurements of position and measurements of momentum, to show the same relations between energy and time.</p>\n"

Of course, we now know this to be the case: if <span class=\"math-container\">$J$</span> corresponds to a coupling constant in your <em>microscopic</em> Hamiltonian, then it always takes the same value in every phase.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>However, as you say in your post, <span class=\"math-container\">$J$</span> does <em>not</em> usually correspond to some constant in the microscopic Hamiltonian: it usually corresponds to some <em>effective</em> coupling. One way to think about this is from the perspective of the renormalization group: your microscopic Hamiltonian might have all sorts of crazy terms with different coupling constants, but upon course-graining and rescaling these coupling constants will generally change. In particular, the renormalization group &quot;flow&quot; of your coupling constants will depend on the phase of the system -- indeed, it's precisely the sudden change in RG fixed point as you tune across the transition that accounts for the sudden change in long-distance behavior of the system. For example, in a simple 2D Ising model, you expect the temperature to flow towards infinity upon starting with <span class=\"math-container\">$T &gt; T_c$</span>, while it will flow to zero for <span class=\"math-container\">$T &lt; T_c$</span>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So in summary, to answer your question: yes, the effective couplings of your system will appear to change suddenly across a transition. One particularly nice example of this is in the KT transition, where the superfluid stiffness undergoes a universal &quot;jump&quot; upon tuning from ordered to disordered. This is because your effective coupling <span class=\"math-container\">$K = \\beta J$</span> immediately switches from flowing to zero to flowing to <span class=\"math-container\">$2/\\pi$</span> at long distances (a nice reference for this is Kardar's <em>Statistical Physics of Fields</em>, chapter 8).

Simulation is quite hard - see <a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/q/38865/26969\">this question</a> and associated answers for some ideas for (free) software you could use. But it's hard to do it right.</p>\n<p>Instead, if you want to go the experimental route, you could do this in a couple of different ways.</p>\n<p>First method: use a white point source at a known distance (it could be &quot;very far away&quot;, but that doesn't actually matter). Of course a real source is likely to be extended, but for this experiment to work well you really want to focus it through a small pinhole that is on the optical axis of the lens. Then put a second pinhole at the other side of the lens, and scan the intensity of the light at a few different wavelengths as the pinhole steps through the nominal focal distance. This is most simply done by sending the light through a grating and capturing the resulting spectrum with a camera; but you could also use monochromatic filters at a few different wavelengths, and you can filter the beam at any point. Note, however, that you don't want to place filters between the pinholes and the lenses, as they may affect the optical path length. You have to put the filter either before the first pinhole, or after the second.</p>\n<p>If I am not mistaken, you would expect to see the intensity of the light coming through the pinhole peak quite sharply as you go through the focal point; but since the focal point will be different for each wavelength, the peaks will not lie exactly on top of each other. Instead, you will get a plot like this (numbers and shape of curves are made up):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzOy7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gzOy7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The peaks should be fairly sharp, as long as everything is well aligned and the pinholes are small: when the focal blur is equal to the pinhole size, the intensity will drop by a factor 4x. Therefore it should be easy to determine the focal length for each wavelength. You should be able to make a plot of focal length as a function of wavelength. For a well compensated lens, that plot will be (nearly) flat; the example graph I gave above corresponds to a lens with a lot of uncorrected dispersion.</p>\n<p>Once you have that relationship, you determine the point of least confusion based on your needs.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have all wavelengths evenly represented in your source, you will want to put the POLC at the unweighted mean of all focal lengths; but if you have a predominantly red image, for example, you will want to use a heavier weight for the red focal length than for the blue.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of a camera I had many years ago that had manual focus (using a TTL microprism). The lens had an &quot;IR&quot; marking on it - so that if you wanted to do IR photography, you would first focus on the visible light, then make a small adjustment to move the focus setting to the IR dot. Of course IR is somewhat more extreme - but that's an example of what needs to be done to get focus right &quot;for the wavelength of interest&quot; (in this image, the camera is focused at 10 m in the IR, 6 m in the visible).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/32FJ9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/32FJ9.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Note - chromatic aberration occurs both on the optical axis, and off it. You notice it more strongly off axis, because it results in characteristic colored fringes at points of sharp contrast. What you are really seeing with such fringes is the fact that with different focal lengths, images are of slightly different size; and the further to the edge you look, the greater the difference in size will be.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the diagram you use in the question seems to relate to spherical aberration; what I described above relates to chromatic aberration. Both of these things matter if you really want the best focus; and both are diminished by using a smaller aperture lens (bigger f-number).</p>\n"

We could define a quantity that measures the mixedness $M$ of the particles as something like $M=(N_B-N_R)/N_\\text{tot}$, where $N_{B/R}$ is the number of blue/red molecules in the cell, and $N_\\text{tot}$ is the total number of particles in the cell.  </p>\n\n<p>Now we can ask which state is more probable: the one with blue on one side and red on the other (unmixed), or the one with nearly equal numbers of red and blue molecules (mixed).   There is only one unmixed state (or I guess two since you could have all the red on the right or all the red on the left), but many many mixed states--remember you don't get to measure positions of individual particles, but just how many of each type are in each cell.</p>\n\n<p>So it boils down to identifying what states are meaningful on the macroscopic scale, and then counting how many different ways there are to produce the macroscopic state.  Then you can assign an entropy to the state which is bigger for states that are more probable (i.e. can be made in many different ways).  </p>\n\n<p>The example of pages in a book being mixed up is a bit more difficult to see how entropy could enter, but the key point is to identify the macroscopic quantities which characterize the state.  For this, we shouldn't ask about the precise position of page 1, page 2, and so on.  Instead, a good macroscopic quantity for measuring disorder could be the number of pages which ended up in the correct location.  Then we see that there is only one possibility where all the pages are in the correct position, but many more possibilities where none of them are in the correct position, and hence the latter option is a state of higher entropy.  You could be more sophisticated about how you define a disordered state (maybe look at how many even numbers are next to another even number and odd next to odd), but the key is to focus on macroscopic properties of the system, and not on the individual position of each page.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>I personally think the text is misleading. It's blindly applying Gauss' law while not considering its subtleties.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a more cause-and-effect way to look at it. After this, we'll get to Gauss' law.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take a look at the positively charged plate. Yes, the surface charge density on one side doubles. But the surface charge density on the other side goes to zero. A known result about infinite sheets of charge is that distance from the sheet doesn't affect the electric field. So, in effect, the region to the right of the positive plate is not affected by the redistribution of charge on this plate. The <em>total</em> surface charge density (if you were to flatten the plate and look at it as truly two dimensional) didn't change.</p>\n\n<p>So, the positive plate's effect on the electric field isn't changed when the negatively charged plate is brought near. <strong>Instead, it's the presence of the second negatively charged plate that doubles the electric field in the region between the plates,</strong> not the doubling of the surface charge density on one of the plates. There is only one doubling going on.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, if you were to somehow take two infinite sheets each with $\\sigma$, and separated them by some small distance, the electric field outside of the region between the plates would be identical to a single infinite sheet with $2\\sigma$. This is a crucial idea. I hope it's clear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why, then, is the text saying it has to do with the surface charge density?</strong></p>\n\n<p>They are applying Gauss' law to a Gaussian pillbox with the left face in the middle of the positive conductor and the right face in the vacuum between the plates. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l4iB2.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>With this choice of Gaussian surface, there is only a flux through the right face. This is convenient for calculations. <strong>However, the electric field that gives rise to this flux is not due only to the enclosed charge,</strong> even though we mathematically calculate it like that. Rather, the electric field one should use in Gauss' law is the total electric field due to all charge distributions, including charges outside the Gaussian surface. This is one of the subtle but amazing facts of Gauss' law: To calculate the flux through a surface, you only need to mentally worry about the enclosed charge, but the result you get for the electric field (if you can indeed extract the field from the flux, usually in a highly symmetric geometry) is due to all of the charge, not just the enclosed charge.</p>\n\n<p>So, for your particular problem from <em>H&amp;R,</em> the flux through the right face of the Gaussian surface is caused by the superposed electric field from both plates. Neither of these fields alone changed, but their effects superpose, causing a doubling of the net electric field. But when applying Gauss' law for this problem, we usually don't worry about what actually causes this electric field. The doubling of the electric field is \"accounted for\" mathematically by the doubling of the surface charge density on the positive plate. However, viewing this doubling of the charge as the <em>cause</em> of the now-doubled electric field is not correct in my opinion.</p>\n"

Instead, let me describe a situation that very loudly cries out for the use of tensor products of two vectors.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the problem of conservation of momentum for a continuous distribution of electric charge and current, which interacts with an electromagnetic field, under the action of no other external force. I will describe it more or less along the lines of Jackson (<em>Classical Electrodynamics</em>, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition, §6.7) but depart from it towards the end. This will get very electromagneticky for a while, so <strong>if you want to skip to the tensors, you can go straight to equation (1)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The rate of change of the total mechanical momentum of the system is the total Lorentz force, given by \n$$\n\\frac{ d\\mathbf{P}_\\rm{mech}}{dt}\n=\\int_V(\\rho\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{J}\\times \\mathbf{B})d\\mathbf{x}.\n$$\nTo simplify this, one can take $\\rho$ and $\\mathbf{J}$ from Maxwell's equations:\n$$\n\\rho=\\epsilon_0\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}\n\\ \\ \\ \\text{ and }\\ \\ \\\n\\mathbf{J}=\\frac1{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B}-\\epsilon_0\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.$$\n(In particular, this means that what follows is only valid \"on shell\": momentum is only conserved if the equations of motion are obeyed. Of course!)</p>\n\n<p>One can then put these expressions back, to a nice vector calculus work-out, and come up with the following relation:\n$$\n\\begin{align}{}\n\\frac{ d\\mathbf{P}_\\rm{mech}}{dt}\n+&amp;\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V\\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E}\\times \\mathbf{B}d\\mathbf{x} \n\\\\ &amp;=\n\\epsilon_0\\int_V \\left[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})-\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) + c^2 \\mathbf{B} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})- c^2 \\mathbf{B} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}.\n\\end{align}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>The integral on the left-hand side can be identified as the total electromagnetic momentum, and differs from the integral of the Poynting vector by a factor of $1/c^2$. To get this in the proper form for a conservation law, though, such as the one for energy in this setting,\n$$\n\\frac{dE_\\rm{mech}}{dt}\n+\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\int_V(\\mathbf{E}^2\n+c^2\\mathbf{B}^2)d\\mathbf{x}\n=\n-\\oint_S \\mathbf{S}\\cdot d\\mathbf{a},\n$$\nwe need to reduce the huge, ugly volume integral into a surface integral. </p>\n\n<p>The way to do this, is, of course, the divergence theorem. However, that theorem is for scalars, and what we have so far is a vector equation. To work further then, we need to (at least temporarily) work in some specific basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1,\\mathbf{e}_2,\\mathbf{e}_3\\}$, and write $\\mathbf{E}=\\sum_i E_i \\mathbf{e}_i$. Let's work with the electric field term first; after that the results also apply to the magnetic term. Thus, to start with,\n$$\n\\begin{align}{}\n\\int_V \\left[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})-\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}\n=\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\n\\int_V \\left[\nE_i(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})-\\mathbf{e}_i\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})\\right)\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}.\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThese terms should be simplified using the vector calculus identities\n$$\nE_i(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})\n=\n\\nabla\\cdot\\left(E_i \\mathbf{E}\\right) - \\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\nabla E_1\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})\n=\n\\frac12\\nabla(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{E})-(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E},\n$$\nwhich mean that the whole combination can be simplified as\n$$\n\\begin{align}{}\n\\int_V \\left[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})-\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}\n=\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\n\\int_V \\left[\n\\nabla\\cdot\\left(E_i \\mathbf{E}\\right) \n-\n\\mathbf{e}_i\\cdot\\left(\n\\frac12\\nabla(\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{E})\n\\right)\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x},\n\\end{align}\n$$\nsince the terms in $\\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\nabla E_i$ and $\\mathbf{e}_i\\cdot\\left( (\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{E}\\right)$ cancel. This means we can write the whole integrand as the divergence of some vector field, and use the divergence theorem:\n$$\n\\begin{align}{}\n\\int_V \\left[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E})-\\mathbf{E} \\times(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}\n&amp;=\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\n\\int_V \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\nE_i \\mathbf{E}\n-\n\\frac12 \\mathbf{e}_i E^2\n\\right]d\\mathbf{x}\n\\\\ &amp; =\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\n\\oint_S\\left[\nE_i \\mathbf{E}\n-\n\\frac12 \\mathbf{e}_i E^2\n\\right]\\cdot d\\mathbf{a}. \\tag 1\n\\end{align}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>In terms of conservation law structure, we're essentially done, as we've reduced the rate of change of momentum to a surface term. However, it is crying out for some simplification. In particular, this expression is basis-dependent, but it is <strong>so</strong> close to being basis independent that it's worth a closer look.</p>\n\n<p>The first term, for instance, is simply crying out for a simplification that would look something like \n$$\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\n\\oint_S\nE_i \\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{a}\n=\n\\oint_S\n\\mathbf{E}\\, \\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{a}\n$$\nif we could only make sense of an object like $\\mathbf{E}\\, \\mathbf{E}$. Even better, if we <em>could</em> make sense of such a combination, then it turns out that the seemingly basis-dependent combination that would come up in the second term, $\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\\,\\mathbf{e}_i$, turns out to be basis independent: one can prove that for any two orthonormal bases $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$ and $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1', \\mathbf{e}_2', \\mathbf{e}_3'\\}$, those combinations are the same:\n$$\n\\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i\\,\\mathbf{e}_i = \\sum_i \\mathbf{e}_i'\\,\\mathbf{e}_i'\n$$\nas long as the product $\\mathbf{u}\\,\\mathbf{v}$ of two vectors, whatever it ends up being, is linear on each component, which is definitely a reasonable assumption.</p>\n\n<p>So what, then, should this new vector multiplication be? One key to realizing what we really need is noticing the fact that we haven't yet assigned any real physical meaning to the combination $\\mathbf{E}\\,\\mathbf{E}$; instead, we're only ever interacting with it by dotting \"one of the vectors of the product\" with the surface area element $d\\mathbf{a}$, and that leaves a <em>vector</em> $\\mathbf{E}\\,\\mathbf{E}\\cdot d\\mathbf{a}$ which we can integrate to get a vector, and that requires no new structure.</p>\n\n<p>Let's then write a list of how we want this new product to behave. To keep things clear, let's give it some fancy new symbol like $\\otimes$, mostly to avoid unseemly combinations like $\\mathbf{u}\\,\\mathbf{v}$. We want then,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a function $\\otimes:V\\times V\\to W$, which takes euclidean vectors in $V=\\mathbb R^3$ into some vector space $W$ in which we'll keep our fancy new objects.</li>\n<li>Combinations of the form $\\mathbf{u}\\otimes \\mathbf{v}$ should be linear in both $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.</li>\n<li>For all vectors $w$ in $V$, and all combinations $(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\in V\\times V$, we want the combination $(\\mathbf{u}\\otimes \\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}$ to be a vector in $V$. Even more, we want that to be the vector $(\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{w})\\mathbf{u}\\in V$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last one looks actually pretty strong, but there's evidently room for improvement. For one, it depends on the euclidean structure, which is not actually necessary: we can make an equivalent statement that uses the vector space's dual.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For all $(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\in V\\times V$ and all $f\\in V^\\ast$, we want  $f_\\to(\\mathbf{u}\\otimes \\mathbf{v})=f(\\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{u}\\in V$ to hold, where $f_\\to$ simply means that $f$ acts on the factor on the right.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, if we're doing stuff with the dual, we can reformulate that in a slightly prettier way. Since two vectors $\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}\\in V$ are equal if and only if $f(\\mathbf{u})=f(\\mathbf{v})$ for all $f\\in V^\\ast$, we can give another equivalent statement of the same statement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For all $(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})\\in V\\times V$ and all $f,g\\in V^\\ast$, we want  $g_\\leftarrow f_\\to(\\mathbf{u}\\otimes \\mathbf{v})=g(\\mathbf{u})f(\\mathbf{v})\\in V$.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[Note, here, that this last rephrasing isn't really that fancy. Essentially, it is saying that the vector equation (1) is really to be interpreted as a component-by-component equality, and that's not really off the mark of how we actually do things.]</p>\n\n<p>I could keep going, but it's clear that this requirement can be rephrased into the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product#Universal_property\" rel=\"noreferrer\">universal property of the tensor product</a>, and that rephrasing is a job for the mathematicians. Thus, you can see the story like this: Upon hitting equation (1), we give to the mathematicians this list of requirements. They go off, think for a bit, and come back telling us that such a structure does exist (i.e. there exist rigorous constructions that obey those requirements) and that it is essentially unique, in the sense that multiple such constructions are possible, but they are canonically isomorphic. For a physicist, what that means is that it's OK to write down objects like $\\mathbf{u}\\otimes \\mathbf{v}$ as long as one does keep within the rules of the game.</p>\n\n<p>As far as electromagnetism goes, this means that we can write our conservation law in the form\n$$\n\\frac{ d\\mathbf{P}_\\rm{mech}}{dt}\n+\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V\\epsilon_0\\mathbf{E}\\times \\mathbf{B}d\\mathbf{x} \n=\n\\oint_A \\mathcal T\\cdot d\\mathbf{a}\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\mathcal T\n=\n\\epsilon_0\\left[\n\\mathbf{E}\\otimes\\mathbf{E}+c^2\\mathbf{B}\\otimes\\mathbf{B}\n-\\frac12\\sum_i\\mathbf{e}_i\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_i\\left(E^2+c^2 B^2\\right)\n\\right]\n$$\nis, of course, the Maxwell stress tensor.</p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on about this, but I think this really captures the essence of how and where it happens in physics that a situation is really begging the use of a tensor product. There are other such situations, of course, but this is the clearest one I know.</p>\n"

This is a convention about what it means to synchronize two clocks. But it is not the only possible convention. In fact, Reichenbach extensively studied an alternative convention where <span class=\"math-container\">$t_B=t_A+ \\epsilon \\Delta t_A$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$0 \\le \\epsilon \\le 1$</span>.

For Einstein's convention the one way speed of light is isotropic and equal to the two way speed of light, and for any other value the one way speed of light is anisotropic but in a very specific way that is sometimes called &quot;conspiratorial anisotropy&quot;. It is anisotropic, but in a way that does not affect any physical measurement. Instead this synchronization convention causes other things like anisotropic time dilation and even anisotropic stress-free torsion which conspire to hide the anisotropic one way speed of light from having any experimental effects.</p>\n<p>This is important because it implies two things. First, there is no way to determine by experiment the true value, there simply is no true value, this is not a fact of nature but a description of our coordinate system's synchronization convention, nature doesn't care about it.

No physical prediction would change if we changed any of those conventions. However, in the case of <span class=\"math-container\">$\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}$</span> a lot of calculations and formulas become very messy if you use a different convention. Since there is no point in making things unnecessarily messy, it is a pretty strong convention.</p>\n<p>Finally, regarding FTL information transfer. If we use <span class=\"math-container\">$\\epsilon \\ne \\frac{1}{2}$</span> then there is some direction where information can travel faster than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span>. However, since in that direction light also travels faster than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span> the information still does not travel faster than light. It is important to remember that under the <span class=\"math-container\">$\\epsilon \\ne \\frac{1}{2}$</span> convention the quantity <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span> is no longer the one way speed of light, so faster than light and faster than <span class=\"math-container\">$c$</span> are no longer equivalent.</p>\n"

See the 8 black dots representing the stars in this figure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXiAq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXiAq.png\" alt=\"Circle of stars orbiting each other\" /></a></p>\n<p>As seen from the outside inertial frame, the stars are all orbiting around the common centre of mass, they experience a gravitational pull towards the centre of mass, and as a result, only experience acceleration directed towards the centre. Because the situation is fully symmetric, that centre of mass will not move, and the stars keep orbiting forever.</p>\n<p>But if we view the situation from one of the stars (the bottom star in the figure above), the situation is different. The gravity from the other stars takes time to reach the star, so their gravitational pull should come from slightly behind their real positions. We assume that gravity travels with the speed of light, then it will appear to pull from a star’s visible location, the white dots in the figure above. As a result, the combined gravity from the other stars shouldn’t pull towards the centre of the circle, but slightly to the right, along the red arrow in the figure.</p>\n<p>This should also imply that the star experiences, besides the radial acceleration, also acceleration tangent to the circle. That is, its speed along the circle should increase. Because this situation is fully symmetrical for all stars, all the stars should gain more and more speed over time, and eventually they should spiral away from each other.</p>\n<p>Because this can obviously not be true, there must be a mistake in my way of thinking. What is it?</p>\n<p>And how does the situation change if there is a black hole in the middle of the circle? Due to the stretching of space around a black hole, gravity should take even longer to reach the other side of the circle?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nThe answer to a\n<a href=\"https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/80916/101743\">similar question</a>\nquoted by @benrg in the comments, links to the following explanation on the web:\n<a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html</a></p>\n<p>The main explanation in this essay is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In that case, one finds that the &quot;force&quot; in GR is not quite central—it\ndoes not point directly towards the source of the gravitational\nfield—and that it depends on velocity as well as position.  The net\nresult is that the effect of propagation delay is almost exactly\ncancelled, and general relativity very nearly reproduces the newtonian\nresult.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They also state that the same is true for electro-magnetism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a charged particle is moving at a constant velocity, it exerts a\nforce that points toward its present position, not its retarded\nposition, even though electromagnetic interactions certainly move at\nthe speed of light. [...] a calculation shows that the force on A\npoints not towards B's retarded position, but towards B's &quot;linearly\nextrapolated&quot; retarded position. [...] This is exactly what one finds\nwhen one solves the equations of motion in general relativity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in short, the gravity will not appear to come from the actual retarded position, but from an &quot;extrapolated&quot; position.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to explain that phenomenon from an intuitive physics point of view, avoiding faster-than-light communication and without going into tensor calculus?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>Your argument is inconsistent because the concept of the center of mass, as used by you, implies instantaneous interaction. If you want to use it with retarded interaction, then the center of mass has to refer to the retarded position of the star at the top, not the instantaneous one (after all, that's what the stars interact with). So you have to move the star positions of the 'source'-stars anti-clockwise so that the white dot at the top is opposite to the center of mass and the (irrelevant) black dot left of it.</p>\n<p>However, there is a further inconsistency in your picture above: the retarded positions (white dots) as drawn by you refer to the black dot at the bottom, but in the inertial reference frame (fixed in the 'paper' plane), whereas they should refer to the <em>moving</em> star as the latter is the target of the gravity signal here. But for your example all the stars move with the same speed on the circle, so the distance between any two of them never changes. So effectively, all stars are at rest relatively to each other and retardation has therefore no visible effect.</p>\n<p>===============================</p>\n<p>EDIT (detailing my answer in view of some of the other answers and comments)</p>\n<p>If we restrict ourselves to just 2 masses orbiting each other, the argument by the OP (which goes actually back to Laplace more than 200 years ago) can be represented by the following diagram</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPfAp.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPfAp.gif\" alt=\"Incorrect model for orbit retardation\" /></a></p>\n<p>According to this, mass <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> is accelerated along its orbit as the force to the retarded position of mass <span class=\"math-container\">$m_2$</span> is not radial anymore. Hence the orbit would be unstable. But this picture is incorrect. As mentioned already, it would apply to a stationary mass <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> but not an orbiting one. As is obvious, the distance of mass <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> to the retarded position <span class=\"math-container\">$P_2'$</span> would be different here from that to the instantaneous position <span class=\"math-container\">$P_2$</span>. But for two masses in a circular orbit the distance between them must always be the same as <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> moves the same distance within a given time as <span class=\"math-container\">$m_2$</span>. If we display the orbit of <span class=\"math-container\">$m_2$</span> with regard to <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> we get in fact the following picture</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yIda1.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yIda1.gif\" alt=\"retarded orbit relative to m_1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Obviously, the retarded position of <span class=\"math-container\">$m_2$</span> has the same distance from <span class=\"math-container\">$m_1$</span> as the actual position. The situation is thus equivalent to one with instantaneous gravitational interaction and thus there is no effect on the dynamics of the orbit.</p>\n<p>The gravitational interaction is something that happens between two masses. It would be incorrect to assume one mass sends out some 'gravitons' that then may (or may not) be absorbed by some other mass. If one wants to display the situation symmetrically in the center of mass reference frame, one should therefore use rather a picture like this</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YTAV.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YTAV.gif\" alt=\"Correct representation in CM frame\" /></a></p>\n<p>The 'gravitons' are sent out by both masses when at the retarded positions and received when at the instantaneous positions. Assuming that the gravitons obey the invariance principle for the speed of light, the latter does not depend on the relative motion of the masses, so the gravitons are sent and received perfectly radially and thus no retardation effect occurs.</p>\n<p>Effects would only occur for elliptical orbits, as there the distance between the masses is variable. For anyone interested, I have recently written a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Smid/publication/346967064_Apsidal_Precession_in_the_Two-Body_Problem_with_Retarded_Gravity_-_Application_to_the_Solar_System/links/5fefa6e692851c13fedf253b/Apsidal-Precession-in-the-Two-Body-Problem-with-Retarded-Gravity-Application-to-the-Solar-System.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paper</a> which calculates the effect of retardation on the orbits of all the planets; as it turns out, the only effect is a small (retrograde) precession of the orbits (note that this paper is as yet not accepted for publication in a journal, so use it at your own risk).</p>\n<p>Contrary to what is frequently claimed, there is thus no General Relativity needed to answer the OP's question, as the retarded force is a central force anyway in a circular orbit.</p>\n"

It says that \"particles\" aren't really particles, nor are they really waves, they're just little objects that have some properties of waves and some properties of particles, and there are certain situations where one is more visible than the other. I've heard it said (in a <em>very</em> rough sense) that subatomic objects travel like waves, and interact like particles. Again, this is a huge simplification, but there's an important intuition, which is that these objects are always a little like waves and a little like particles. We can describe their position by a function that tells you the <em>probability</em> that the object will be at a particle point in space at a particular time; this function takes the mathematical form of a wave, so we call it a <em>wavefunction</em>, and this is the sense in which particles are like waves.

Once more, I emphasize that this is a very big simplification, but just for the purposes of giving you a bit of context, we can imagine that as the electron travels through the slits, its wavelike character is more obvious, and so there are noticeable behaviors we normally attribute to classical waves, like interference. When it collides with the backboard, however, its particle-like character is more obvious, and so we see a single point where the electron collided with the wall. <em>But at all times, the electron had both wave and particle characteristics</em>, and that's the essence of wave-particle duality.</p>\n"

Any force perpendicular to the tunnel (in case the tunnel doesn't pass through the center of the earth) is ignored. </p>\n\n<p>I worked it out and the equation is $a = -\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho G d$, where $d$ is the distance from the center of the tunnel and $\\rho$ is the density of the earth. </p>\n\n<p>Clearly, it is simple harmonic and therefore the period is constant and has no dependence on which two points were used to make the tunnel. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an intuition for why this should be the case? I imagine some Gauss' law type of argument should work here, but I cannot see it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: More to the point, why even when the tunnel does not pass through the center, one obtains the same period. Is there any deeper explanation as to why this should be the case?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>The fact that the period of the gravity train that passes through the center of the Earth is equal to the period of an orbit that skims the Earth's surface is not a coincidence. Consider a polar orbit around Earth (i.e., one that passes directly over the coordinate north and south poles). Now, consider only the north-south motion of the satellite by projecting the motion onto a line parallel with the Earth's axis. What kind of motion is this? Circular orbits have a constant speed, so the 1-D motion must be sinusoidal. The gravity train is just a circular orbit where the motion off the Earth's axis is restricted. Perpendicular forces and motions can be treated independently. See the animation below to illustrate. The spinning arrow shows the path of a satellite, while the straight lines show the path of the gravity train for perpendicular tracks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3o4a.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3o4a.gif\" alt=\"animated circles and sine waves\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, what about gravity trains that don't pass through the Earth's center? First, notice that your expression for the acceleration of the train does not depend on the distance from the Earth's center. As long as the track is symmetric about the Earth's radius, then you will get the same train motion no matter the depth of the track. The ends of the track do not have to connect to the surface. You can also reason that the depth of the gravity train track does not matter by starting with a track that connects to the surface at both ends and then adding a shell around the entire planet to increase its radius. Inside a spherical shell, the gravitational force is zero, so burying the track does nothing to the motion.</p>\n\n<p>To start to demonstrate this, let's prove a similar fact about circular orbits: the period of an orbit that skims a planet's surface depends only on the planet's density, not its size.\n$$F = m\\frac{v^2}{R} = \\frac{GMm}{R^2}$$\nwhere $F$ is the gravitational force, $m$ is the mass of the satellite, $M$ is the mass of the planet, $v$ is the speed of the orbit, $R$ is the radius of the planet, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n$$v^2 = \\frac{GM}{R}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{2\\pi{}R}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{GM}{R}$$\nwhere $T$ is the period of the orbit.\n$$T = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi{}^2R^3}{GM}}$$\n$$T = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi{}^2R^3}{G\\rho\\frac{4}{3}\\pi{}R^3}}$$\n$$T = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{G\\rho}}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Now, starting from your expression for the train acceleration:\n$$a = -\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho{}Gd$$\nwe can derive an equivalent mass-spring system(*) with a spring constant $k$ given by\n$$k = \\frac{F}{d} = \\frac{ma}{d} = \\frac{4}{3}\\rho{}Gm.$$\nThe period of this mass-spring system, and thus of the train, is\n$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2m}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho{}G}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{\\rho{}G}}$$\nNotice that this is the same period as the satellite.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: The gravity train is a 1D projection of the 2D circular orbit where the length of the train track is the same as the diameter of the orbit. The time to traverse the track is the same no matter the length or the depth because the period of a surface-skimming orbit around a constant-density planet is independent of the size of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>(*) Everything is physics is ultimately a mass on a spring.</p>\n"

The change in kinetic/potential energy depends only on the height difference between points.</p>\n<p>If there were non-conservative forces like friction acting here, the trajectory would make a difference. You could imagine that if the object slides along the path with friction, it would lose some energy to friction with every inch moved.

This implies\n$$\n\\frac{p}{c} = \\lim_{v\\to c}\\lim_{m\\to0} \\frac{ m}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\n$$\nApplying this same limit to the kinetic energy, we get\n$$\nKE = \\lim_{v\\to c}\\lim_{m\\to0}  \\left( \\frac{ m c^2}{\\sqrt{ 1 - v^2/c^2}} -  m c^2 \\right) = \\frac{p}{c} c^2 - 0 = p c\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the equation you first wrote down!</p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>Edit: to people asking about details, I am not asking about drag. Take it to happen in vacuum, space, no drag, no other forces. I would like a general rule of thumb. This guy with e equals mv squared answered already.</p>\n<p>This is NOT about relativistic speeds.\nTo go from point A to point B, in theory (maybe) I could use a certain amount of energy. If I go twice as fast, I will use energy at a double rate but only for half the time. So integrating over time the energy expenditure would seem to be identical.\nOf course in the real world, it does not work like this. Cars consume far more oil per mile when they go faster.\nI can understand that certain aspects of engines might not react in a linear way to what is asked of them.\nHowever my question is more general. Is there a universal law of physics that makes it more costly to go faster to the same destination?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <blockquote>\n<p>If I go twice as fast, I will use energy at a double rate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not quite correct. First, in the absence of any external force, going at constant speed doesn't require any energy consumption. However, energy is needed to reach a certain speed even in the absence of external forces.</p>\n<p>If you move with speed <span class=\"math-container\">$v$</span>, your (kinetic) energy is <span class=\"math-container\">$E=\\frac 12 mv^2$</span>. However, if you move with speed <span class=\"math-container\">$v'=2v$</span>, your energy will be <span class=\"math-container\">$$E'=\\frac 12 mv'^2=\\frac 12 m(2v)^2=2mv^2=4E.$$</span></p>\n<p>These amounts of energy, <span class=\"math-container\">$E$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$E'$</span>, need to be provided for reaching speeds <span class=\"math-container\">$v$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$v'$</span>, respectively (assuming you start from rest).

        "golden_answer": " <p>Actually, both your suggestions can be correct depending on the magnitude of F. In equilibrium <span class=\"math-container\">$F=mg\\sin\\alpha$</span> + static friction. Now if <span class=\"math-container\">$F&gt;mg\\sin\\alpha$</span> then the object should move up the ramp, so to balance it static friction acts down the ramp. If <span class=\"math-container\">$F&lt;mg\\sin\\alpha$</span> then the object should move down the ramp so to balance it static friction must act up the ramp. And if <span class=\"math-container\">$F=mg\\sin\\alpha$</span> there is no need for static friction. So the direction of static friction depends on whether <span class=\"math-container\">$F$</span> or <span class=\"math-container\">$mg\\sin\\alpha$</span> is larger.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>Schrodinger was following Hamilton, deBroglie and Einstein. DeBroglie had noted that matter waves obeyed a relation between momentum and wavenumber, and energy and frequency,</p>\n\n<p>$$ E = \\hbar \\omega $$\n$$ p = \\hbar k $$</p>\n\n<p>For plane waves of the form $\\psi(x) = e^{ikx - i \\omega t}$, you learn that the $\\omega$ and the $k$ of the wave are the energy and the momentum, up to a unit-conversion factor of $\\hbar$. Einstein then noted that the DeBrodlie waves will obey the Hamilton Jacobi equation in a semi-classical approximation, and Schrodinger just went about looking for a real wave equation which would reproduce the Hamilton Jacobi equation when you use phases.</p>\n\n<p>But the end result is easier than the Hamilton Jacobi equation. For pure sinusoidal waves, the energy and wavenumber are related by</p>\n\n<p>$$ E = {p^2\\over 2m}$$</p>\n\n<p>Which means that the plane wave satisfies the free Schrodinger equation</p>\n\n<p>$$ i\\hbar {\\partial\\over \\partial t} \\psi = -{\\hbar^2 \\over 2m} \\nabla^2\\psi $$</p>\n\n<p>You can check that for a sinusoid, this reproduced the energy/momentum relation.</p>\n\n<p>If there is an additional potential, when the wavelength is short, the wavefronts should follow the changing potential to reproduce Newton's laws. The way this is done is to add the potential in the most obvious way</p>\n\n<p>$$ i\\hbar {\\partial\\over \\partial t} \\psi = -{\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi + V(x) \\psi $$</p>\n\n<p>When $V(x) = A - F\\cdot x$, where A is a constant offset and B is a constant force vector, the local frequency is slowed down in the direction of bigger potential, curving the wavefronts downward according to Newton's laws.</p>\n\n<p>One way of seeing that the equation reproduces Newton's laws comes from Fourier transforms. There is a group-velocity formula for the motion of wavepackets centered at a certain frequency and wavenumber:</p>\n\n<p>$$ {dx\\over dt} = {\\partial \\omega \\over \\partial k} = {p\\over m} $$</p>\n\n<p>This equation comes from the idea of beating--- waves with a common frequency move together, but the location of constructive interference changes according to the derivative of the frequency with respect to the wavenumber. Identifying the freqency with the energy and the wavenumber with the momentum, this relation reproduces one of Hamilton's equations of motion as a law of motion for the wavepacket solutions of Schrodinger's equation (in the limit of short wavelengths).</p>\n\n<p>The other Hamilton equation can be found by Fourier transform, which makes the wavepacket in k become a wavepacket in x, and the group velocity relation becomes the equation for the changing k as a function of time.</p>\n\n<p>$$ {dp\\over dt} =  - {\\partial \\omega \\over \\partial x} = -{\\partial V\\over \\partial x}$$</p>\n\n<p>Schrodinger's equation is really is the first thing you would guess, and there is no need to make Schrodinger's straightforward ideas look intimidating or axiomatic. It is much more transparent than Heisenberg's reasoning of the time, or for that matter, Einstein's.</p>\n"
