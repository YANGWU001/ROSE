Ideally, I'd like to know not just where they are best found, but during what chapters I can use those sources and what alternatives are available after those points.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the purple energy hex in the diamond shape seems to be almost completely absent at the stage of the game we're at. It is only ever dropped by a single normal enemy (the Outcast STG in the Hughes Power Station), which does still occasionally spawn but is more often replaced by the more annoying Mask Raiders who do <em>not</em> drop purples. Unless we somehow skipped over it, we also have not found any Arena battle that drops purple hexes. And all of the encounters where they used to be dropped (primarily on Level 6) have been replaced with more difficult battles that prefer to give greens instead.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

She hinges heavily on her abilities - a shield for her teammates and a shield for herself - but these have very short duration and relatively long cooldown. As a result, Zarya feels very punishing to play.</p>\n\n<p>I love Zarya's fantasy and character design, but I'm not effective when playing her. How can I utilize Zarya's skillset to benefit my team?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>I've found it most effective to use Zarya as artillery support with her alternate fire, which lobs an exploding ball of energy in an arc. Like Pharah's rockets, these explosions have small splash damage that quickly falls off the further away the enemy is from the explosion, so don't expect to deal more than 150~ damage withing a single reload if you're at 0 energy. Zarya's primary fire has very short range and unless you have good tracking, it won't deal much damage, so her secondary fire is better to use at a distance, and you want to stay at a distance until you've built up enough energy to kill enemies faster than they can kill you.</p>\n\n<p>As you said, Zarya's gameplay revolves around her two shields. Both shields are identical except for cooldown (10 seconds for the self shield, 8 for the projected shield): they last a maximum of 2 seconds, they can absorb up to 200 damage, they protect from impairing effects like McCree's flashbang and Mei's freezing effect, and each individual shield can only charge Zarya's energy by 40 at most. It's also worth noting that if a shield is up, it will always fully absorb the hit that destroys it, even if the shield had less health than the absorbed hit. For example, a shield will always save yourself or an ally from D.Va's Self-Destruct, even though it deals 1000 damage.</p>\n\n<p>The way Zarya should be played depends a lot on her current energy; while it's low, you don't have big changes of surviving a fight, since you won't be able to kill enemies before they can kill you. The basic idea is to attack from far away while your energy is low, using your secondary fire to safely damage the enemy while peeking around corners, and whenever your shield is up, you can run out in the open for 2 seconds and absorb energy from the enemies' attacks, which will make your grenades much stronger. Each point of energy translates to 1% extra damage from both primary and secondary fire, so you can see how much difference 80+ energy would make in Zarya's damage output. The secondary shield can be projected on your allies whenever they're being focused down, and it's a good idea to place one on a beefier tank than you like D.Va or Reinhardt while they're out in the open. Once your energy is high enough, around maybe 75+, you can afford to be aggressive and lead the charge, but keep in mind that your survivability still depends largely on having your self shield. Even on high energy, it's a good idea to attack mostly with your secondary fire unless in very close range, or against a large, slow tank that is hard to miss with your primary beam.</p>\n\n<p>Zarya's ultimate is best used in conjunction with Barrage or Self-Destruct, but you can deal pretty good damage with a 100 energy alternate fire. Keep in mind that Graviton Surge does not prevent enemies from attacking and using abilities, so if you're not careful you might be quickly brought down before being able to pump out enough damage to be worth the ultimate.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Zarya works well with almost any allies, IMO, but she can't fulfill the role of primary tank, so you always want to pair with one. Low health heroes who still want to be fighting like Tracer and Reaper will benefit greatly from 200 extra health when they're caught out, heroes who can't fight on their own like Mercy and suitless D.Va will survive that bit longer when the enemy comes to flank them, big tanky heroes won't be helped by shields as much, but you'll love the instant 50 energy from the attention they draw, and finally, big AoE damage dealers or continuous damage dealers like Junkrat, Pharah, and Bastion, or high damage ultimates like Hanzo's, Genji's, and D.Va's work really well with Graviton Surge. Just make sure not to use it together with Winston's or Roadhog's, since they'll push enemies away from the black hole.</p>\n"

Does this count in WoT? For example does using the latter makes my tank accelerate significantly faster?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not looking for acceleration-based information it was just an example.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>I've not been able to found numbers on a ratio of weight vs acceleration difference.</p>\n<p>According to this <a href=\"http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/topic/53842-weight-speed-acceleration-for-scouts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">World of tanks forum post</a> (last answer), weight affects your acceleration and hill climbing ability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Top speed, acceleration, and turn rate.  Top speed appears to be fixed per vehicle.  Acceleration (and hill climbing speed) are based on power/weight ratio.  More powerful engines increase acceleration and hill climbing, more weight (from modules or equipment) decreases it.</p>\n<p>Tracks change your turn rate and up your weight capacity.  Grousers, torsion bars, etc bump your wight capacity.  The more of that extra weight capacity you use, the slower you will accelerate or climb hills.  Better drivers/commanders/vents bring all 3 closer to their stated 'perfect' stat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also stated <a href=\"http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/40207-suspension-weight-limit-and-speed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this thread, first answer</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a) Weight does affect acceleration but top speed is fixed. Weight limit has no effect on acceleration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also further in that thread :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yes, a tank without equipment will accelerate faster. Although a one ton spall liner makes a much bigger difference on a 15 ton tank than it does on one that's 100 tons. I've found about 5% extra weight is noticeable and 10% and easily noticeable so most of the time equipment doesn't make much difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for your case with the <a href=\"http://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:PzII_Luchs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Luch</a>, you should notice a difference in acceleration with the lighter gun since the tank is a light one.</p>\n<p>Also, note that the wiki states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once upgraded, the Luchs gains incredibly high acceleration, the ability to turn on a dime often causing it drift when turning at high speeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the best engine, you might still notice the difference but the pros of having a upgraded gun might be worth more than the increase in acceleration since the top speed will remain the same. Rare are the maps where you should not be able to reach near top speed before encountering enemies.</p>\n<p>You'll need to try what fits your playstyle best but for the information available, if you have the best engine, you should get the bigger gun and use half a load of ammo to reduce some weight, remove any equipment that are not needed for your scouting/playstyle and still be able to dish some damage while scouting efficiently.</p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>Last night I needed to save some cash in my large, self-sustaining, city after building a brand new University. Looking through the options of what to turn off, I decided to turn off my high school and community college, just leaving my grade schools as the other education options. My cities tech level continued to advance, rapidly in fact, and all my industries started upgrading. My education level also rose significantly after the first day of university classes.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, <strong>once you have a University, can you safely turn off or demolish your high school and community college to save funds? Is there a downside to doing this?</strong></p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <h1>Yes you can!</h1>\n<p>You can potentially turn off all other education buildings after building a university - all education buildings convert kids into students and subsequently enrol that student, however each education building provides a different level of education and influences the tech level of your industry.</p>\n<h2>Thus, I present to you Arcadia!</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KbLvf.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia\" /></p>\n<p>Here is how I came to my conclusion - I was previously of the opinion that 'students' and 'kids' were separate agents and being unable to find anything solid to confirm it either way, so I figured it was time for science!</p>\n<p>If you are not reaching the maximum number of students enrolled, it will like be down to one of the following reasons;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not enough capacity</li>\n<li>Not enough coverage</li>\n<li>Traffic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Universities provide the highest level of education and the biggest boost to your industry (to tech level 3), but relies on your city's mass transit system and road network to allow your students to get to it. School buses will not drop students off at university. A university also allows you to research projects to create great works for your region and provide upgrades for your buildings.</p>\n<p>A community college provides many of the educational benefits of a university and is smaller in size, but doesn't provide the same amount of improvement to your industry (to tech level 2 only).</p>\n<p>If you have a university in your city, you should consider shutting down your community college, provided your road network and mass transit can handle it your university will have no problems teaching the students from your college.</p>\n<p>Grade schools and high schools are basically the same building but with different capacities. Each provides its own transit system that can pick up students but provides a lower level of education than a university or community college.</p>\n<p>You do not need a grade school or a high school, but it's worthwhile having at least one for the benefits that they provide as these schools will pick up the kids in your city to keep them off the streets, reduce crime, pollution, trash and energy consumption while providing a bonus to the amount your sims recycle.</p>\n<p>As for getting the maximum tech level and maximum education level <em>just</em> with a university? It's not impossible. In many of my screenshots above you can see that I'm at tech level 3 with just a university, but the overall education level hovered at around 3 out of 5. I didn't get an education level higher than 4 during any of my testing with universities so this leads me to believe that either not enough time was given to allow the education level to rise to maximum (the oldest city I used during testing had only got to year 3) or that it isn't possible to get the maximum education level with just a university.</p>\n<p>One of the main challenges I faced while trying to build a comprehensive education system that enrolled all students was transport, sending out fleets of buses would gridlock my road network during school hours. One tip I have for this as a result of my testing is that all a school bus will drop off students at another school of the same type, regardless of whether that bus originated from that school.</p>\n<h2>A few things I noticed while testing</h2>\n<p>I noticed that the value for the number of students being taught on the university overview is another number that doesn't tally up with the education overview;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fooy.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fooy.png\" alt=\"University overview\" /></a></p>\n<p>This city has never had a grade school, high school, public library or community college - the only source of education has been via the University.</p>\n<p>A university is also able to teach in excess of the maximum number of students that can be in class at once;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2q8SJ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2q8SJ.png\" alt=\"Teaching 3646 students, but only 3300 in class at once\" /></a></p>\n<p>I noticed that during the initial growth of the city, the number of sims enrolled would lag behind the spurts in growth in that large portions of the population were not enrolled;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUnMX.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUnMX.jpg\" alt=\"March - Year 1\" /></a></p>\n<p>A few months later and you start to see your overall education level rise. As the population increase begins to plateau the number of enrolled students catches up to the total number of students available, although I still haven't seen the number of enrolled students at 100% at this point;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bRZJP.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bRZJP.jpg\" alt=\"June - Year 1\" /></a></p>\n<p>By this point, I am noticing that I'm getting a fair quantity of &quot;Too many injuries - moving!&quot; - which is usually a sign of low education, however my overall education level is still increasing, and my industry tech level has already reached 3.</p>\n<p>In addition, I am still seeing a specific group of sims that are not enrolled into my education system. In the following two screenshots, you will see <code>Kids</code> represented by purple bars (which is actually shown on the data layer as <em>not enrolled</em>) and <code>Students</code> represented by green bars (which also means <em>enrolled</em>);</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/87ijz.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/87ijz.jpg\" alt=\"Datalayer showing Kids\" /></a></p>\n<p>In all instances, the purple bars identify themselves as <code>X Kids</code>, while the green bars identify themselves as <code>X Students</code>;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MDxPS.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MDxPS.jpg\" alt=\"Datalayer showing Students\" /></a></p>\n<p>When the university is in use, it is populated by students. With this in mind, I plopped down a high school - the next morning the education data layer showed no instances of people not being enrolled while the total number of students enrolled wasn't at 100%;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmPQD.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmPQD.jpg\" alt=\"Kids waiting at bus stops represented by blue bars\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the above screenshot, you can see a new set of 'blue' bars - these bars represent kids/students waiting at school bus stops. In this instance, all of the kids have relocated to waiting at the bus stops for their high school buses (note that universities <em>do not have</em> a dedicated transit service).</p>\n<p>Shortly after placing the High School my city went through a sudden population growth phase which increased the number of kids in the city. With all of the additional kids in the city I was able to see a pattern. Outside of school hours my education data layer would look like this;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8QAfO.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8QAfO.jpg\" alt=\"Education data layer outside of school hours\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then, once the school buses had started picking the kids up for school, which is shortly after the school opens at 6am, my city's education data layer would look like this;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5ucI.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5ucI.jpg\" alt=\"Education data layer during school hours\" /></a></p>\n<p>During this, my number of students enrolled did not noticeably fluctuate, and neither did the number of students being taught at my university, however the number of kids in the city had reduced and were arriving at the high school.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the traffic problems I was having, I made a new city to test with. In this city I built a road network that didn't suffer from the same traffic problems - I found that my overall enrolment reached 100% quite quickly. Even at 100%, looking at the education data layer showed un-enrolled sims;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVKks.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVKks.jpg\" alt=\"Education data layer in a city with better roads\" /></a></p>\n<p>Like before, these were all kids, and adding a high school to the city would get them off the streets and show no un-enrolled sims on the education data layer.</p>\n<p>For an additional test, I built a city that only had a high school to try and work out exactly what effects a high school has;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1lcQY.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1lcQY.jpg\" alt=\"high school city before 6am\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again the purple bars when you hover over them show up as <code>kids</code> in all instances. After 6am the fleet of school buses set off, and pick up all of the kids from the various bus stops, and the education data layer shows this;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0DYZ.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0DYZ.jpg\" alt=\"high school city after 6am\" /></a></p>\n<p>In every instance of a bus picking up a kid form their home, that kid turned into a student upon arrival at the high school.</p>\n<p>For further testing I destroyed the high school and left the city until the number of students enrolled had reduced back to zero and then built a grade school in the same location that the high school previously resided;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RlCer.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RlCer.png\" alt=\"Grade school after destroying the high school\" /></a></p>\n<p>However after the fleet of school buses went out at 6am, the results were pretty conclusive in that enrolment increased to the point where the grade school was full;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4fgC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J4fgC.png\" alt=\"Grade school at maximum capacity\" /></a></p>\n<p>The grade school was already fully upgraded so it was not possible to increase the capacity further so I added enough additional grade schools to cater for the maximum number of potential students that could enrol and waited until the next day. While this still didn't result in reaching the maximum possible number of students (due to a localised capacity issue) I am confident it would be possible to get 100% of all students enrolled using just grade schools;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Te5dZ.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Te5dZ.jpg\" alt=\"One grade school stubbornly remained empty\" /></a></p>\n<p>In order to do so though, required a new city - one of the main problems I've faced trying to get 100% enrolment in large cities is that school buses clog up your road network quite easily if you're trying to fetch all your students from one centralised location. In this city I placed four grade schools, one in each corner;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2XOT.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2XOT.png\" alt=\"City with four grade schools\" /></a></p>\n"

That said, <em>don't</em> turn on the Diggle Gods levels, and don't take any portals to the Wizardlands, as both of these are just going to increase the odds of you biting it.</p>\n\n<p>My skills were:</p>\n\n<p>Master of Arms, Perception, Burglary, Unarmed Combat, Battle Geologist, Alchemy, and Smithing.  </p>\n\n<p>Battle Geologist requires an expansion, and Smithing was kind of underused in this build, so I provided some backup skills for your consideration in the full guide.  I'd almost suggest a ranged weapon tree of some sort.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very \"tanky\" build, where you're going to focus on defensive stuff.  Dual wield shields, and focus on Block, damage resistance, and elemental resistance.  Learn to exploit the AI to trap it in corners and halls where the enemies can't surround you.  This will get you through the majority of head-on encounters.  </p>\n\n<p>For very deadly fights, especially against magic users, (such as Dredmor himself), you're going to want high amounts of sight radius.  If you can find a spot where you can see these guys at range but they can't get close to you, you can plink away at them with thrown weapons or crossbows.  Failing that, the Perception tree's Eye Lasers do decent damage, and they don't require mana to use.  </p>\n\n<p>You can also use Burglary's Lockdown ability at range to hold them still and get away if things are looking bad.  Burglary's \"Lucky Pick\" ability also means you can close all doors (ie, you're not bashing down locked ones when you're out of picks), so prepare to immediately close doors once you open them.

This requires an unbroken line of loaded chunks from spawn with hoppers pointing into them - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDHfxApRMQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this youtube video</a> seems to be the most referenced design (plus an explanation of how it works).  It basically involves using hoppers to keep the chunks loaded, and requires an unbroken chain of loaded chunks between spawn and where you want to be loaded.</p>\n\n<p>*Your ping only measures the round trip time.  You need to be concerned about the actual connection speed, or how many bits/second can be sent.  </p>\n"

The best way to do that is from behind the arch you came into the map.

The first thing you have to target are the glowing purple orbs in the tentacles. As long as the tentacles are around they shoot missiles at you in periodic intervals. And let me tell you those hurt! Only weapon suitable for this is the sniper.</p>\n\n<p>Second thing is the tongue. The boss has a vertical mouth. Once you've destroyed the tentacles this thing starts opening on occasion and a tongue shoots out trying to hit you. You have to hit that. Best way to do it is the sniper gun. If you manage to time it right you can use the 11010101 or RPG.</p>\n\n<p>When you have destroyed the tongue the eye part begins. Occasionally the eye opens and shoots a bright beam at you. When it does that the eye becomes an easy target. You can hit the eye in between attacks too but it requires rather good aim. From time to time the tentacles will grow back again and you'll have to shoot them off a few more times so it's important that you save enough sniper bullets for that and use the slower ranged weapons for the eye.</p>\n"

However, rather than let them hit you in melee, you should keep your distance and only allow them to cast their draining spell as this is the only attack that can impart the disease. To speed up contraction, repeatedly lose and gain sight of the target vampire so the spell is cast multiple times. The check for giving you the disease is passed only when the draining spell hits you, not over sustained action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the trick is to fight Vampires and force them to use their Vampiric Drain spell on you.

We're all decent laners, but when it comes to mid / late game, we're kinda screwed by the lack of strategies and tactics to defeat the enemy team. That's why I'm asking about overall strategies and good ways to rotate after the laning phase. What are good ways to:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Win against a push combo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's assume, enemy team has good pushers (Cait, Ziggs) and every siege is in vain, since the minions always never reach the enemy tower?

How do we react to this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Win with a Poke combo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously we try to siege and when we got them low, we can engage. Does this mean, we should pick a good dive champ, since we eventually want to do that?</p>\n\n<p>These are just some scenarios I could think about. Maybe there is also an online resource with overall strategies / guides how to make a good teamcomp according to the strategy we want to play?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>The thing with teamrankeds is that the laning phase isn't the same as in soloqueue. In soloqueue the rotation isn't really there. While it would be good to have one, most of the time those 5 random people that are matched together just don't have enough teamplay to rotate right. In 5v5 Premades you can communicate better and you can try to get help from another lane. What I basically wanna say is: Focus on rotation right from the beginning and don't try the \"I'll win my lane so I can carry\" because most of the time you won't carry alone and as soon as you have an advantage you won't have to rotate too much. Also try to 3 or 4 man gank botlane a few times early because ADC is by far the most important role to get fed in premades.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your 3 questions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I win against a push combo</strong><br>\nPusher comps usually have a lot of movementspeed, poke, splitpush or waveclear. They can siege very well and they can also take objectives down either because of high range or because of high objective-burst. Now what a pusher comp usually lacks is definitely the ability to teamfight. The best thing to do is Initiating on them as soon as someone who attacks the turret stands too close. I assume you named Caitlyn as an example because of her 650 range with autoattacks. But think about it: 650 Range may be huge but she still is vurnerable as soon as she starts attacking the turret. Also If a bruiser attacks the turret just ignore him and punish him for not protecting their squishy roles. Usually as soon as an ADC gets stunned he should be dead. Another thing that should be taken into concideration when playing against a pusher team is taking a champion with good waveclear. You actually have to take just one champion that can clear a wave fast and they can't really push (Cait won't risk a turret shot if there is a chance she gets stunned while having turret aggro).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I turn the game arond when the enemy team has the momentum?</strong><br>\nWell this is actually pretty easy if they really push all lanes. Ward the jungle and go 5 man mid. Unless you haven't screwed up completely you will push a lot faster than they do and if you ward properly you can catch them as soon as they wanna stop you:</p>\n\n<p>Example. <br>\nShen pushing top<br> \nTheir jungler is somewhere in top jungle<br>\nSupp/adc/mid pushing bot.<br>\nNow what you wanna do is Go mid as 5. Usually Botlane will stop pushing and come to you. Shen will wait till he can ult to the ADC/Midlaner. Since you know that they are coming from bot and that shen will ult you also know that their jungler isn't there. The jungler is usually rather tanky and in midgame teamfights tanks are the biggest problem. This means that you can go bot as 5 since there  are 2-3 squishy targets with the potential of a tank teleporting in but as soon as one of the targets is dead there won't be enough damage to kill you 5 just because of a missing bruiser. Of course this isn't the only imaginable situation but I hope you get the point. Try to find somewone where you have a big chance of killing him.</p>\n\n<p>Now if they aren't pushing all lanes and are sieging you have to clear waves again and try to find their mistakes. If they really are just as good as you and they have an advantage your only chance to win is by their mistakes (but don't worry they will do mistakes). You can try to make them feel overconfident by sending someone to a place that seems isolated while you are wating somewhere near. Another thing to try is if you have better scaling champions. If this is the case just try to stall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we win with a poke combo?</strong><br>\nWell there are two options as an addition to the poke part of your team: <br>\nEither you pick champions that can push well or: <br>\nYou pick a champions with high mobility.</p>\n\n<p>I really wouldn't recommend picking an AOE initiater or something like that since poke usually comes from the Midlaner/ADC and most of the champions that can poke well are rather poor teamfighters (sure there are exceptions but not too many). The main argument that speaks against picking an initiator is that you will lose against a team with a stronger teamfight midlane/ADC.</p>\n\n<p>So as I already mentioned the best tactics here are: Hit&amp;Run and Ultra siege.</p>\n\n<p>Also try to make them feel unconfortable by baiting them to baron. This allows for poke and pushing potential (Just make sure that everything's warded) since you can't really take baron / dragon against a poke comp.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you wanna know how to find good team comps just go for statistics (I made a small summary of the most common team comps <strong><a href=\"https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/160778/good-champions-pick-and-strategies/160784#160784\">here</a></strong> and what their strengths and weaknesses are if you're interested, but It's by far not everything you can say about teamrankeds). I assume that you know that guides won't help forever if you say that you play teamrankeds/tournaments. There are no guides but only statistics and small tips that will improve your playstyle after a certain level.</p>\n"

So, the system requirements for games usually give a recommendation for the minimally required GPU and CPU for both Nvidia and Intel hardware.

I have a Nvidia 840 M. How can I find out if this is sufficient? (Though I would also like to know if my GPU is sufficient for HotS, this question is rather a general on how to read those system requirement statements)</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>Unfortunately there isn't really a concrete way to look at models numbers and know how they will perform or which is better. Model names are arbitrary and naming schemes may change from time to time. However, manufacturers have some incentive to have at least some kind of coherent naming scheme at any given time for marketing purposes. If you want to compare specifications of a particular card (for example: your own graphics card) vs the required or recommended specification you can look up both at the manufacturer's website and attempt to make an informed decision. Also note that 3rd party services and benchmarks are usually available that will give you a moderately accurate numeric representation of the graphic cards' performance. A third alternative would be to search the internet and see if anyone is running that particular game on either the same or similar hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, you can check either the manufacturer's website or a retailer to try and glean information on the naming scheme. In the Nvidia example GTX 650 vs a GeForce 840M. You'll probably be able to note that the \"naked\" GeForce branding in general isn't as powerful as \"GeForce GTX\" and that the \"M\" stands for mobile and will generally be lower performance and feature limited but also require less power. To go into specifics the first number is (for example: the 6 in 650) generally denotes the generation of card and the following numbers will normally donate the intended performance. </p>\n\n<p>So to give some full examples, a GTX650 compared to a GTX750 will likely be very similar in terms of performance. The 750 may run cooler, require less power or have additional features but any difference in actual performance will be at best marginal assuming that the manufacturer didn't change their naming scheme. Another example I can give that will be more illustrative would be a GTX 590 vs a GTX 960. The 960 is much newer, has more features and so on but isn't close to the performance of the 590 (despite being a much bigger number!). However, it's worth noting that with such a large timeframe between the two cards, the gap between the performance of an old \"X90\" and a new \"X60\" will slowly close due to improvements in technology, manufacturing, and to a minor extent developers targeting and testing with newer graphics cards.</p>\n\n<p>As I said earlier, it's mostly arbitrary and Nvidia have changed their naming scheme between the 7600 GT and the GTX 650. AMD also have their own naming schemes that they can change too (and they are likely to differ from Nvidia's at any given time). Your best chance at a general rule is to check a 3rd party website and hope that they are accurate. The example given in your post could be checked on a website like <a href=\"http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=1243&amp;cmp[]=2873&amp;cmp[]=2155\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Developer hardware recommendations are sometimes inaccurate.

        "golden_answer": " <p>There are certain ways you can attempt to fix a chunk error:</p>\n\n<p>For server use:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3vzaxo/mobs_frozen_not_burning_in_daylight_cant_hit_them/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>It could be that your TPS is set low. TPS is much like FPS but for the server. It cannot go above 20, and it should stay at 20. TPS stands for Ticks Per Second. This applies to singleplayer, as it runs a sort of local server when you load one, this is to allow opening to LAN.</p>\n\n<p>Common symptoms of low TPS include the sky jumping back a little bit every second making it look laggy and extending length of day/night cycle, mobs/entities (not including players) moving unusually slowly, all entities that can take damage take it much more slowly with delay, all entities effected by gravity falling slowly in choppy little bits, players seemingly teleporting around in multiplayer (purely visual), blocks difficult to place/destroy (multiplayer and in extreme cases in singleplayer), etc.</p>\n\n<p>Check your game's Ticks Per Second by typing <code>/gamerule randomTickSpeed</code>\nIf the speed is set to larger then 3 then we may have found your problem.  Set it back to 3 if it is set higher.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With a little research I think WorldBoarder may solve your problem it allows you to fully generate (fill) your world all the way to the border, filling in any missing chunks, including a configurable buffer zone just outside your border.  </p>\n\n<p>With a little help you can also make another possibility possible.  If you were to create another account and keep that account in the needed chunks then it is possible that the chunks won't unload keeping them fully functional.  I Found a great video that could go hand in hand with this idea: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBSO4hBKBGs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Super Chunk loader</a></p>\n\n<p>If this is the most important part in your world that isn't loaded, you\n    could place it in your spawn chunks.  Spawn chunks stay loaded in\n    your world because they are stored in your memory.</p>\n\n<p>You could also use the commonly talked about hopper chunk loader which may keep the chunk loaded all the time. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/egqsmXD_oCM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hopper Chunk loader</a>  <strong>As an edit</strong> to your comment on how loadding your whole map would be an inconvenience, I found another Chunk loader that can be set to load only one chunk: Here is the link:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atBzZ7Qg1hA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minecraft 1.8.8 Remote Chunk Loader Explained</a></p>\n\n<p>It is possible and <em>could be likely</em> that you have a corrupted chunk even if it says you don't.  There are different types of corrupted chunks, but there are ways to patch, fix, and delete depending on the problem.  This would require MCedit to fix.  I would suggest copying this part of your world with commands or Woldedit before you try this, if you still can.  If you close your server for a bit and load it up in single player, you can attempt to patch it using this method: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRfxdIQfUPQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Corrupted chunk fix for single player</a>  You may need a similar fix like this, but not this one, so this will only get you to the starting line and help in your search.</p>\n\n<p>As a final thing I found a mod that may do what you want.  It is called CodeChickenCore.  In this mod it has something called ChickenChunks, This is what it should include: This introduces a new block called the “Chunk Loader”, which allows chunks to be loaded in memory at all times. It is very convenient to use as it comes with a special GUI for configuring chunk loading. Chunks are also free to load.</p>\n\n<p>I found this download <a href=\"http://azminecraft.info/codechickencore-mod-minecraft/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here.</a></p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <ul>\n<li><strong>Play to the strengths of the class you're playing</strong>. These rules bend a lot but you'll learn that with experience.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assault</strong> - Drop ammo packs near teammates. Pick off guys at medium distance. Long distance works well too but that's best effective on defense. Shoot your grenade launcher at bunched up enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Engineer</strong> - Repair friendly vehicles, blow up enemy vehicles. Shoot vehicles with the RPG-7, shoot soldiers with the Carl-Gustav. The CG does less damage but the rocket travels faster and has a wider damage radius. Your SMG is best used at close range.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any class can use the tracer dart, but here's how to lock onto it. Once it's on the vehicle, look down the sight of your RPG at the red blinking square in the direction of the beacon. Once it stop blinking, you have about two seconds to shoot. You can even shoot straight in the air to curve it around buildings and terrain. You don't need line of sight to lock on. You do not need to stay aiming until it hits. Once it's locked, it's locked, but the next time you shoot you'll need to lock again.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Medic</strong> - Drop med kits near teammates. Revive dead teammates with your paddles (they appear as lightning bolts on the map and your HUD). Your light machine gun doesn't do much more damage than other guns but you have quite a bit more ammo per magazine. Best for medium distances.</li>\n<li><strong>Recon</strong> - Throw your motion mines, this reveals enemies in a small area as blips on you and your teammates maps. Use C4 to blow up vehicles that get too close (you can't throw them very far) and use mortar strikes to disperse camping enemies. Mortar strikes don't damage the M-Coms in Rush, but C4 does. Motion mines can also be an excellent offensive tool for rushing a building.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Spot</strong>. Push the spot button like you're on crack. (Back on 360, Select on PS3, Q on PC) This puts a blip over the enemies' heads and on the map. This can also be very useful if visibility is low due to smoke or if you're not used to iron sights, since the blip is drawn on top of your weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't drive vehicles</strong> until you have some experience. This includes the UAV. It's fun, but you're not as invulnerable as you may feel and you can get blown up very quickly. Blow up a few before you drive one. You can practice flying helicopters in empty servers. You do not want to crash a helicopter full of teammates.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't snipe</strong>. It takes a good sniper to be a benefit to the team. The problem is everyone wants to snipe and too many snipers on a team probably accounts for 20% of losses. In my opinion, sniping is most useful to your team at medium ranges since you can use your motion mines.</li>\n<li>This might be a given to some, but <strong>don't camp</strong>, especially when you're attacking. Camping is staying in the same spot for more than a few minutes. The longer you stay in one spot, the more likely the enemy is going to find you and throw a grenade your way or otherwise kill you. Be a moving target both in firefights and in the long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Spawn on your squadmates</strong>. You can spawn directly behind them by selecting them in the spawn menu. If the server allows you to see your squadmate before spawning then make sure he's not in too hot of a situation before you die alongside him and waste a ticket.</li>\n<li>Shoot in short bursts. Each shot adds to the spread cone of your bullets. Just pretend it's a pistol and click a lot.</li>\n<li>BC2 uses bullet simulation instead of traces. So at long distances you'll need to aim high and lead (aim in front of) your target.</li>\n<li>Did I mention you should spot?</li>\n</ul>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>First of all we need to see the <em>advantages of going mid-lane solo</em>: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Faster XP gain</li>\n<li>Easy to gank either top or bottom lane</li>\n<li>Easy to get the runes (+bottle efficiency)</li>\n<li>Better lane protection (this means the enemy doesn't really have so much space to chase you on lane as they would have top/bottom so it's harder to be killed.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is good to go solo mostly because of the faster XP gain which is a huge factor.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the facts listed above, we can follow-up with the 2 following reasons to go mid-lane:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You are a <strong>carry</strong> hero. Being a carry hero requires fast leveling/farming and the mid lane  offers this to any decent player. If you can't farm that well, still you will level faster anyway. \nNow, 80% of cases are in the first category. This means you need a carry oriented hero which preferably can also farm/deny. This means most will be ranged, but there are some good melee heroes too. In what follows I will give some examples of some good range/melee heroes for mid:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Riki</strong> is my personal choice, but if you are a beginner do not take him as he is a little hard to manage. Riki is one of the best carries in the game due to high damage and smoke screen which is just imba (imbalanced). You will have difficulties in farming especially if you are up against ranged heroes. Early smoke will help out a lot. Blink/smoke farm will get you easily to lvl 6. Then go gank or keep farming like a boss if your opponent is a noob and doesn't yet have wards.</li>\n<li><strong>Shadow Fiend</strong> is a great carry, one of the easiest farmers there are in the game, has good ulti with blink dagger or lothar's and generally good at harassing. This will definitely be in the top choices for mid heroes.</li>\n<li><strong>Bloodseeker</strong> Passive for regen from creeps is just great. With axe for 32% damage vs creeps you will probably never need to go fountain for regen. When you hit 6 you can easily gank.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>You have a good <strong>ganker</strong> hero. This means you have for instance <strong>Pudge</strong> or <strong>Mirana</strong> which after quickly achieving level 5-6 can go fast top/bottom for gank and get kill 100% sure if they get hook/arrow. Also take <strong>Tiny</strong> for example. Getting fast lvl 7-8 when all the other players are level 5 will get you easiest kill ever with avalanche/toss combo. <strong>Bane</strong> falls easily in this category with level 6. <strong>Lion</strong> due to ultimate of course, but arguably better as support/roamer. <strong>Tinker</strong> has so much burst damage at level 7-8, leveling him fast is a good idea as he can easily get some early game kills.</p></li>\n<li><p>You are a good <strong>harasser</strong>. This means you can really slow down the enemy's mid hero leveling/farming. Most of the time you won't see this happening but I've seen this in some games. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This doesn't cover all heroes but hopefully will give you a good idea to start with.</p>\n"

This led to The eventual defeat of all Dragons (save Paarthurnax). However, Alduin was <em>not</em> defeated, he was simply pushed through time, to the present day.</p>\n\n<p>When he arrives, he is capable of summoning forth meteor storms, and even raising the dead - this is because from his perspective, he only \"vanished\" for a short period of time - he is still at the height of his power. The other Dragons, however, have been dead for centuries.</p>\n\n<p>Dragons are believed to have a close affinity to magic. But, if left dead for long periods of time, it would make sense that much of their power has left them, and needs to be restored. It would then make sense why a handful of mere mortals would be able to kill one on a simple reconnaissance mission. </p>\n\n<p>This is further supported by the idea that while dragons fighting could be described as a \"heated debate\", but I would argue that there would have to be some form of residual power involved in using a Thu'um - otherwise that Dragonborn would likely be killing a lot more people simply by sneezing violently.</p>\n\n<p>So, my belief is that Dragons require some level of affinity with Magic to be able to use the Thu'um to it's full effect, which does require time, and training.</p>\n"

Don't worry, the level 50 quests are easily doable at level 45, because all of the mobs are Swarm. When you get you first legendary item, you'll get a quest to get it to level 10. This will take you some time, so go quest somewhere else in the mean time.</p>\n\n<p>East Angmar is very difficult to navigate. There are many grouping quests there, so if you are solo'ing don't go there.</p>\n\n<p>You will also have some more places to go in Forochel.

Make sure you have a goat, such as the one you can get from getting Kindred with Thorin's Hall.

It requires Friend standing to enter and has many easy quests, as well as the Instance quests (kill 25 orcs inside a moria instance) and the Battle for Lothlorien (it's like a skirmish but can only be done at fellowship difficulty)</p>\n\n<p>You can also get nice cosmetics and jewlerry</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>60 to 65</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mirkwood or Enedwaith</p>\n\n<p>I really hate Mirkwood.

There is teal-quality cloaks and necklace at kindred level.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>65 to 70</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dunland</p>\n\n<p>Dunland is very simple to understand. The quests go in a counterclockwise circle, from the top left to the Rohan Scout-Camp. There are some really good instances, such as \"Tusks of the Boar.\" </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>70 to 75</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Gap of Rohan, Isengard (Nan Curinir), and The Great River</p>\n\n<p>At this point you can go south of the Rohan-Scout Camp and find some Rohhric Camps. These have lots of quests, and then when you are done here, if you are still not 75, then go to Isengard, which is north of Grimbold's Camp.</p>\n\n<p>When you are at level 75, go back to Galtrev and go near the Auction Hall.  There will be a guy named Mabon and his father. Doing these quests will teleport you to the Ox-Clan Merchant Camp, which will leave you ready to do the Tower of Orthanc and the Isengard Instance Cluster. </p>\n\n<p>Also, make sure you get the quest from the White-hand guard from the south-gate. These will start a quest chain that will leave you ready to do Draigoch.</p>\n\n<p>As for the Great River...you have Limlight Gorge rep to get for the teal-quality jewelry set.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>75 to 80</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Start off by heading to Lothlorien and the House of Celebrant. You should have gotten a mail at level 75 asking you to do this. This will start you on an epic quest to go to Rohan. I recommend doing these first as otherwise you will do a lot of traveling.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the epic quests and the </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Epics</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The epic quest line gives very good rewards and generally will show you which areas to quest in.</p>\n\n<p>Completing volume one will give you a teal weapon and a title.

You can't make person #1003 be named Joe, wear black jeans that live here and drives that car.

You simple drive past (or murder) the vast majority of them anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The exceptions are of course the scripted events and missions, which contain specific characters that act in a specific way according to the story.</p>\n\n<p>Now what we can do is extrapolate.

        "golden_answer": " <p>As a Spy main, these points hold for fighting Spies in any game mode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep your back to the wall</strong> when dueling a Spy. If a Spy is confident enough to attempt to take you on 1v1 they will be looking for opportunities to stab an exposed back - don't give them that opportunity. </li>\n<li><strong>Don't fall for feigns</strong>. Otherwise known as 'Matador Stabs' or 'Strafe Stabs', a Spy will sometimes feign moving right then quickly move left (or vice versa). If you attempt to track them when aiming you may get caught off guard as the next thing you know they've got angle on your back. </li>\n<li><strong>Take corners wide</strong> when pursuing a Spy. Competent Spies may attempt a 'Corner Stab'. Another feigning tactic, the Spy rounds a corner then doubles back in an arc around the corner. If you're in hot pursuit, you will round the corner, likely facing the direction you expect them to be in, but the Spy has doubled back around in a wide arc and is now in a position to stab you.<br>\nIf you take corners wide, you can see this coming and be better placed to avoid it.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't get distracted</strong> - Whether a Spy gets a stab or not, their next priority is <em>usually</em> to get out of there. Give chase for a little bit but if you don't manage to kill him, don't break off from the front-lines to hunt him down - having you run circles in the back lines looking for him is <strong>as good as killing you</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Don't backpedal away from Spies</strong> - Circle-Strafe away from them instead. Not only do you run slower running backwards, but a Spy may have more chance to get a '<a href=\"https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/index.php?title=Backstab&amp;redirect=no#Issues\" rel=\"noreferrer\">facestab</a>' on you if you're both bumping into each other.<br>\nThis is due to a bunch of weird lag compensation calculations: the game tries to work out where you both actually are, and it may think the Spy is behind you and allow him to backstab, even though on your screen he was clearly in front of you.</li>\n<li><strong>Spies can be fast</strong> - The Big Earner gives a speed boost on kill.</li>\n<li><strong>Spies can be tanky</strong> - The Kunai gives Overheal on kill</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Medieval Mode</h2>\n\n<p>The majority of the above holds true in Medieval Mode (especially point 2,  dueling spies in Medieval is like 90% feign tactics). Here are some more targeted Medieval-mode specific pointers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn the Map</strong> - DeGroot Keep is (currently) the only official Medieval Mode map - it's small but has some hidden features, for example\n\n<ul>\n<li>Demoknights can charge up the rock to get onto the battlements</li>\n<li>Snipers can light their arrows on fire using the Braziers and Torches scattered around the map.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Fight on the points</strong> - All three points on DeGroot Keep are partially surrounded by walls so keep your back to them as much as possible when fighting Spies. You will also be helping capture/defend the points themselves.\n\n<ul>\n<li>In general, avoid spending time in the Battlefield area (grass/hill) as much as possible - the map is very small, and this is the biggest and most effective area for a Spy to hang around and escape from situations in.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Watch for drop-stabs</strong> - Spies (and any other enemy for that matter) can drop off the battlements onto Points A and B, or onto the entrance of the keep when the gate is up. \n\n<ul>\n<li>They can also drop from behind the tree onto the path near the cliff, so watch out for this as you sneak past on your way to 'B'.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Listen for decloaks</strong> - Dead Ringer is one of if not 'the' most common Invis-watch on Medieval due to the ability to escape a bad situation with the 3 second speed boost, and ability to weaken critical hits (15% chance to crit in melee). Given that the map is so small, there aren't really any 'safe' spaces for a Spy to decloak in full silence.</li>\n<li><strong>Spychecking still exists</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Mad Milk (Scout)</li>\n<li>Bleed-effect weapons (Tribalman's Shiv, Boston Basher etc)</li>\n<li>Sharpened Volcano Fragment (Pyro) &amp; Lit Arrows (Sniper) will cause afterburn </li>\n<li>Soldier's banners (check the 'buff' rings at friendly player's feet - Spies won't get the buff </li>\n<li>Bumping/Hitting everyone with melee still works, especially in cramped-quarters like the keep's courtyard and capture points.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Call out the Spy</strong> - Get used to pressing <kbd>X</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>.

        "golden_answer": " <p>So this is complicated, but not much worse than <a href=\"https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/138526/1351\">preventing a player from crafting a diamond sword</a>.  The biggest difference here is that everything <em>must</em> happen on the same tick, and it <em>must</em> happen every tick. This precludes the strategy I used in the linked answer; a 20hz fill clock is pretty much a necessity, whereas I could use a slower, simpler clock in that other answer.  For this to work, you're still going to want to disable mob griefing, as I'm using ghast fireballs to create the actual explosion.  It's also possible to have the effect, but cause 0 damage to players or other entities, and I'll add the commands for that at the end.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is to set up a scoreboard objective to track TNT that's about to explode:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/scoreboard objectives add TNTGoBoom dummy\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, we need to set up a <code>fill</code> clock.  You'll need two command blocks in a column with an air block separating them.  In the bottom, enter the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fill ~ ~1 ~ ~3 ~1 ~ air\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and in the top one, enter this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>fill ~ ~-1 ~ ~3 ~-1 ~ redstone_block\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Put a redstone block between the two, and you have your fill clock.  Ideally, this won't be near a chunk boundary, but mine was and it still worked fine.  Funny stuff can start happening if part of a fill clock gets unloaded from memory, but if it's a spawn chunk or you're always near the clock, you don't have to worry.</p>\n\n<p>You should see three more redstone blocks out one side.  You're going to put down three more command blocks adjacent to the redstone blocks (preferably above or below).  In order of closest to the first two command blocks, the commands you want to use are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>scoreboard players set @e[type=PrimedTnt] TNTGoBoom 1 {Fuse:0b}\nexecute @e[type=PrimedTnt,score_TNTGoBoom=1] ~ ~ ~ summon Fireball ~ ~ ~ {direction:[0.0,-1.0,0.0],ExplosionPower:4,Fuse:0,Time:-1,TileEntityData:{CustomName:\"TNT\"},ActiveEffects:[{Id:14,Duration:10,Amplifier:10,Ambient:1}]}\nkill @e[type=PrimedTnt,score_TNTGoBoom=1]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, let's go over those three commands.  The first sets the scoreboard value for the TNTGoBoom objective to 1 for every TNT that's ready to explode on the next tick.  This is how we track the TNT.  The next command summons an invisible fireball at the exact location of the TNT, moving directly downwards, and with the same explosive power of a piece of TNT.  This is what will actually cause the explosion effect and damage to players/entities, but since mob griefing is turned off it won't damage the terrain.  Finally, we <code>kill</code> (effectively delete) the TNT that's about to explode so that <em>it</em> doesn't damage the terrain.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now if you want to still have the explosion effect without causing any damage, then you need to replace the fireball summon command with 2 command blocks (and therefore extend your fill clock by one more block):</p>\n\n<pre><code>execute @e[type=PrimedTnt,score_TNTGoBoom=1] ~ ~ ~ particle hugeexplosion ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 1\nexecute @e[type=PrimedTnt,score_TNTGoBoom=1] ~ ~ ~ playsound random.explode @a ~ ~ ~\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These two commands create the particle effect and sound of TNT exploding, but that's it.  There's no damage to the world, players, or entities if you use this instead of the fireball method.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Addendum:  So this is really going to mess up things like TNT cannons.  I had this running in my creative world where I was previously testing <a href=\"https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/156130/1351\">an infinite TNT cannon</a>, and while it kinda works (the projectile TNT still shoots out a bit), it has a tendency to send a fireball into the sky.  Also, using this means that each TNT block needs to be lit individually, since with mob-griefing off, the fireball won't light others nearby.  I'm sure there's a way around this with a little more command-block-fu.  Actually, I know there's a way to do this, I'm just not 100% on the details yet.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>So let's get the obvious thing out of the way:</p>\n<h3>Yes. It is indeed very possible to destroy the two nexuses at the same &quot;time.&quot;</h3>\n<p>That's because of how &quot;time&quot; works in computer games: discrete intervals that are by no means &quot;tiniest amounts of a second&quot;.</p>\n<p>This is how most game servers are written, due to the nature of modern computer networks being packet based (that is, in bursts of bits as opposed to a continuous flow of data):</p>\n<pre><code>while the game is running:\n  collect the players input\n  update the game state accordingly\n  if anybody has met the winning conditions:\n    declare them winner\n    stop the game\n  send the players the new game state\n</code></pre>\n<p>This loop can be implemented in many ways — especially the &quot;update the world accordingly&quot; part — but the fact remains that this is a loop, and it only runs so many iterations every second.</p>\n<p>A typical performance targets here is 30 or 60 updates (or ticks) per second, or an update within 33 or 16 milliseconds (that's short, but certainly not microseconds short!). So long as the Nexuses... Nexi... final bases go down in the same tick, then they've gone down at the same &quot;time.&quot; Example with made up numbers:</p>\n<pre><code>Tick number         96987 96988 96989 96990 96991 96992\nBlue team nexus        69    60    55    30    15     0\nPurple team nexus      45    45    30    25    10     0\n</code></pre>\n<p>What Nexus died first here? You can't tell.</p>\n<p>Further complicating the matters here is network lag and compensation thereof. From the <a href=\"https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Valve Developer Community</a> comes this handy graph for the Source Engine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/e/ea/Networking1.gif\" alt=\"Server and game ticks\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since packets take time to reach the clients, this means that the <em>clients are playing in the past</em> (and the amount of time they do come in the past depends on their ping), and their user inputs come from even further back. As a result, the server might have to essentially &quot;rewrite history&quot; around them.</p>\n<p>In one player's &quot;user input tick 105&quot; packet, you can claim to fire a bullet directly through another player's skull. This other player's &quot;user input tick 105&quot; packet arrives a few moment later, claiming he stepped to the right. Whoops!</p>\n<p>Of course the server can't keep things in limbo for too long; there is a grace time after which the server must finally update the world state once and for all, and if the second player's packet arrives too late, then the shot will still count as a headshot.</p>\n<p><sup><strong>Nitpickers' corner.</strong> Actually in this case, the Source Engine will award the headshot no matter what; this is why heavies for example can kill you &quot;through&quot; walls.</sup></p>\n<p>So, at the end of the day, it still <em>is</em> possible to have both nexuses go down at the same time.</p>\n<p>Now, since the Nexus can't move around, there is a bunch of optimizations that can or can't be done that muddle the waters significantly more. Unfortunately, this logic is all on the server-side of Riot's; unless a group of 10 players sufficiently close to their data centers can dedicate significant amount of time to SCIENCE, there is little hope that we can figure out <em>how</em> League of Legends actually resolves ties, as it's rather blindingly obvious that the game does not allow ties.</p>\n<h2>No. It is blindingly obvious that you cannot draw a game.</h2>\n<p>Riot <a href=\"http://www.riotgames.com/our-games\" rel=\"noreferrer\">boasted</a> that in January 2014 27 million players played League of Legends daily. Thus, the lower bound for the number of games played on the service daily is 2.7 million.</p>\n<p><sup><strong>Nitpickers' corner.</strong> Depending on how you define &quot;player&quot; it is perhaps possible that some of the 27 million players won't actually play at all and just log in to check their profile page or the tribunal or whatever it is that LoL players do. On the other hand many more will play more than one game. At any rate, I don't have a better number to work on.</sup></p>\n<p>Now, it is true that I cannot find any report about the possibility of drawing League of Legends games on the internet. This discussion has happened already on the League of Legends forums multiple times (<a href=\"http://forums.eune.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=431624\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EU NE forums</a>, <a href=\"http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/board/showthread.php?t=106627\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EU W forums</a>, <a href=\"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1312698\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NA forums</a>, ...); if some player did experience a draw, we would know about it.</p>\n<p>Let's guesstimate the odds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1% of the LoL games ends with both nexi being attacked at the same time.</li>\n<li>0.001% of the LoL games ends with both nexi being destroyed in the same <em>tick</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That means the number of draws that would happen every day is 2.7 million × 0.01 × 0.00001 ~= 3. There would be 3 draws per day. The game as grown in popularity over time since 2009, so let's say that averages out to just 2 draw games per day. The game has been out for 1,768 days today, so that's 3,536 draws since ever.</p>\n<p>How come we know of <em>no single draw,</em> then?</p>\n<p>If draws are so rare, they would make for an excellent YouTube video at least, or for some interesting screenshots. &quot;You won't BELIEVE how this League of Legends game ended!&quot; So you can bet that people would post about them, write about them, upload videos of them. If nothing else, people would write about it in the threads that have come up earlier. Additionally, videos like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXX3Fd9Z9R0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> would include lines about the game ending in a draw, together with all of the unusued lines, but they don't.</p>\n<p>The silence is deafening.</p>\n<h2>So what?</h2>\n<p>The only rational explanation is that there can't be draws in League of Legends and that the game server, somehow, resolves ties and awards victory to one and only one team.</p>\n<p>There are several ways in which this could happen, and we are unlikely to know which one is being used, everything else being equal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ties can be resolved always in favour of the same team</li>\n<li>Ties can be resolved with a coin toss</li>\n<li>Ties can be resolved to the team with more kills/gold/whatever (although you then need to handle ties for this stat, too)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I had to guess, I'd agree with a variation on the team &quot;favour team X over team Y every time&quot;, as it's the simplest solution to deal with a situation you clearly don't want or can't handle.</p>\n"

The high level character will not insta-kill most mobs on a low-level map. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2dy1ck/pve_coop_level_disparity/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Evidence</a> suggests that the weapon damage of the higher level character is scaled down. Specifically, I can visit old russia on earth with my level 20 character and still not one-shot everything. They go down easier than I remember, but some mobs may still require 2 shots.</p>\n\n<h2>Player Damage</h2>\n\n<p>It seems mobs also have a way of damaging you. If I run into a group of level 2 mobs on old russia as my level 20, I will still take damage enough to kill me. It seems to take longer than I remember but I'm not safe.</p>\n\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n\n<p>The level 1 character will earn XP if he's close enough (distance-wise) to the level 10 character. He will earn the same XP whether he kills the mob himself, or if it's killed by the level 10 character. Dregs gave us 20 xp each whether we helped kill it or not.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically we tested with the lower level character just running alongside me and when I killed mobs, he got XP. Same way the other way around, if he killed a mob, I got XP even though I did nothing except tag along.</p>\n\n<p>The same XP is awarded to both players, so obviously the higher level character will require a lot more dregs to be killed before levelling up.</p>\n\n<p>Note the distance remark above. If the two players venture too far apart, no XP is rewarded from kills the other player does.</p>\n\n<h2>Item Drops</h2>\n\n<p>Item drops will mostly be according to the zone level. If you're playing as a level 10 character in a level 2 zone, you'll get level 2-3 drops, with the occasional item more appropriate for your level. Encrypted engrams will, as noted elsewhere on the interwebs, be decrypted at the level you have when you decrypt them so they're just as useful in a level 1 zone as a level 10 zone. No idea whether drop rate is affected though.</p>\n\n<p>Item drops are also personal, which means that all the ammo and item bulbs that you see on the ground is yours.</p>\n\n<h2>Mission Rewards</h2>\n\n<p>Mission rewards is a one-time event. You only get the rewards when you complete the mission the first time. However, as a higher level character you have a higher chance to get encrypted or decoherent engrams containing shiny loot, which offsets this. It is not a waste of time to play with your lower level friends!</p>\n\n<p>So to recap:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Low-level character earns XP when he kills mobs, and he earns the same XP when the high-level character kills mobs, the latter only if the two characters are actually playing together (ie. not on opposite ends of the map). I don't know what the distance range is but it wasn't exactly stand-on-top-of-each-other either.</li>\n<li>Low-level character earns item drops as usual, according to the zone. As does the high-level character, but he'll get some item drops that aren't useful (too low level).</li>\n<li>High-level character is slightly overpowered for the zone, but not to the extent that you can level the zone just by sneezing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's probably best to be fairly close in levels, then both/all players will have the most fun and the most to gain, but there seems to be no adverse effects of bringing a high-level friend to help a low-level character, except for the high-level character not really getting a lot out of the process except the friendship.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mega-conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Destiny is meant to be played together, it seems Bungie has made a system that allows this, even if the players are not the same level.</p>\n\n<p>So team up soldiers, the darkness must be pushed back!</p>\n"

I knew it would end like this, but her stats were just too great to resist!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, a few years down the road, and my trusty spy master lets me know that my beloved son is looking to usurp me.

I'm young (40ish) and well-liked. I have a new heir, but I'd prefer to keep my lands for myself and give him the ones of the previous heir — one duchy and two counties currently held by my grand daughter.

I have limited crown authority, but can bump it up to medium if it suits me.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>So my questions to you are as follows:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is it possible to disown a son, considering I have just cause for imprisonment? An execution would of course settle the deal, but my other vassals would probably find me \"cruel\".</li>\n<li>Is it possible to plot against a character which is not yet of age?

The dukal title I could\nsimply revoke for free (although at a opinion penalty from the\nduchess). Should she die today, one of the counties would be\ninherited by her younger sister, and the other would be inherited by\nme.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I found this to be an interesting development: Turns out my new heirs wife suddenly died. Who did he marry, other than the same scheming hag who presumably killed off his brother, and made an attempt at me? By a suspicious coincidence, I died not very long after.

The plot was successful but the truth came out that I did it, so I got the Dishonorable trait and, even worse, the Kinslayer trait which gave me massive relationship penalty to my family and vassals.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>Last hitting (the act of killing hostile creeps to get gold and experience) is vital in Dota 2 especially for carries. Looking at some \"pro\" players streaming I see that they almost get all last hits, but I have some timing difficulties. How can improve my last hitting skill other than play, play and play? Are there any tecniques to learn that can help me?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>When you're last hitting in Dota2, a lot of the damage from creeps is being dealt by the ranged creep. Notice which enemy creep it's attacking and often simply just time your projectile to hit immediately before or immediately after the ranged creep's attack to ensure the last hit. You should be hitting each enemy creep exactly once- this way your enemies won't have a chance to deny it while you're waiting for your next attack. If your opponents are too close to the wave, especially if they're melee and you're ranged, you can harass your opponent to completely remove the ability for them to deny you. Doing this will draw creep aggression to you, however, so you should usually start to back away as soon as your attack is released to minimize the damage you'll take (none, if you've positioned properly). If you feel like you're in a good position, you can also animation cancel (begin walking towards your target) as soon as the attack is released, and usually get off more attacks and really harass your opponent. Just be careful when chasing past the creep wave, you usually don't want to expose yourself that much unless you're in a strong position and an creep wave can do a surprising amount of damage.</p>\n\n<p>Your starting items will also help you to last hit in lane dramatically. My typical ranged carry build is a +3 primary stat, a +2 all stats, and three +1 all stats items, and a health potion or tangos. This gives you adequate health regeneration, +95 HP, and +8 damage, and builds nicely into a Magic Wand and a Wraith Band/Talisman. For melee carries, I usually buy a Stout Shield, a health potion, tangos, and three +1 all stats items. I see a lot of new players buy boots or other worthless items first that don't help them win the lane, they just lose it less dramatically. You'll be surprised how simple choices like this can help you crush a lane early against equally skilled opponents who are making bad choices. If you're a melee hero competing with a hard hitting melee hero or an opponent who keeps denying creeps, consider buying a Quelling Blade to improve your damage. If it lets you get 3 last hits you otherwise wouldn't and then you sell it, it's more than paid for itself.</p>\n\n<p>One concept calling animation canceling is unintuitive at first but incredibly important both in lane and in general. To perfect your last hitting, you'll need to know how to do this and understand your hero's attack point. Here's a full list of <a href=\"http://www.devilesk.com/dota2/heroes/herodata/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Attack Points</a> that's sortable (add the Atk Point column)- they typically are between .3 and .6 seconds, with a few outliers. A lower attack point is better because it lets you prepare an attack faster. It's kind of like riding the edge of a trigger: you want to be really close to firing as often as possible, but not actually fire until you're sure of it. When you know your hero's attack point (which will improve over the course of the game as you gain attack speed), you can start attacks and cancel the animation just before it completes by pressing S or H, immediately being able to start another attack. Doing this repeatedly is very effective for faking attacks and causing your enemy to misplay- they won't know when your true attack will be coming out. To last hit with ranged heroes you'll also have to account for projectile speed, which also varies but can be seen in the same link.</p>\n"

You can either talk to him or turn on the Silver Shroud Radio and he will mention armor upgrades waiting for you, since you are the best Shroud. These are level specific. </p>\n\n<p>The Silver Shroud Radio will also seem to inoperative at this point (not a bug since at the end of saving Kent, he specifically mentions not doing the radio ever again). But at each of the upgrade levels for the Silver Shroud Armor (25?/35/45), Kent will go on the air in Goodneighbor and call for the Silver Shroud at which point you can talk to him in the Memory Den for the Armor upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>And never cross my path, I am the Shroud!!!!

However, I find it very hard to play as an actual assault, compared to others like McCree, Reaper, and S76, who are more straightforward damage dealers. He has a mobility passive and two abilities with semi-long cooldowns, but it feels like at range, his damage is really weak and unstable, and trying to track enemies with shurikens feels so hard to do. As a result, Genji feels very punishing to play; getting in too close gets me killed and staying at range makes me feel useless for the rest of my team.</p>\n\n<p>I love Genji's design and his skins, even got a legendary Nomad skin for him, but I just can't seem to play him at all. How can I utilize Genji's skillset to benefit my team and to benefit his role as an assault?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p><em>My answer is mostly an opinion supported by a few hours of play with Genji.  Someone with more experience may be more credible.  Key points in bold text.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Genji is fragile, but extremely mobile.</strong>  His double jump, wall climb, and dash attack allow you to get to positions many other players won't always be watching due to the limited number of ways to access a given point.  Open windows and high ledges are your friend.  These are typically sniper positions, which you can sometimes utilize as ambush positions or as an escape to disengage a serious foe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>He needs to win each battle with another hero within the first few seconds of engagement.</strong>  If you're in close, use the right click (secondary fire) of your shuriken attack to release all 3 of your shurikens in a burst, rather than in succession.  There are times where the speed difference could matter.  If you are harassing at range, plink with left click (primary fire).  Be very careful about harassing with Genji, as many characters return fire can cripple or kill you.  Always be moving if you can, and be aware of your possible cover positions before you fire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Engage targets that are isolated.</strong>  Striking a group is going to get you killed relatively quickly.  The exception to this case is having your ultimate ready, which you can readily dispatch groups with the sword, if you catch the party unaware such as from a flank or rear attack.  Genji is largely about situational awareness and how to punish holes in defense lines with swift, brutal attacks.  If you are striking a stronger character, such as a tank class, you may wish to wait until they are distracted by another attacker as you may not be able to kill them before they react to you.  Again, pick targets you are likely to kill, not necessarily ones you might only wound.</p>\n\n<p>If you are spotted during an engagement by a ranged attacker, using deflect will buy you some precious seconds and can even save you from a handful of ultimate attacks.  Be aware your deflect is telegraphed visually to your opponents with swirling red glows in front of you and may increase your visibility, despite the client-side visual only showing Genji to be holding his short blade in a defensive posture.</p>\n"
