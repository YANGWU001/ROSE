Please use an ISO file for Windows 8 installation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd love to know if anyone has any hacks to <strong>lower the minimum required version to Windows 7</strong>. Most of the posts I see talking about Boot Camp and Mavericks say that the wizard offers you Windows 7. I assume, then, that this change has happened in one of the updates since Mavericks was first released (or a bunch of people hastily updated their Lion/Mountain Lion blogs with Mavericks / 10.9 just for Google juice).</p>\n\n<p>Oh, how I would love to follow the dialog's advice, and \"use an ISO file for Windows 8 installation.\" That's only half sarcastic; I hate Windows 8 with a passion, but I honestly did try to make it work, and couldn't (see below).

Of course any suggestions for bypassing the below problems will be appreciated as well.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen other posts where they explain how to get the bootable USB drive working by editing the minimum machine required in Boot Camp's <code>info.plist</code>, but I couldn't find anything in that file to mess with to lower the minimum Windows version supported - that all seemed to be about hardware requirements. I actually have had absolutely no problems creating a bootable USB drive for Boot Camp (once I realized that Windows requires about 40 more bytes than typically found on a 4GB thumb drive), or getting Boot Camp to offer me the option to use a bootable USB drive.

NTFS formatted from Windows 2000, worked flawlessly and interchangeably with more modern versions of Windows, including switching back and forth between Windows 2000 in a VM, and Windows Vista (at the time).</p>\n\n<p>But still, NTFS just wasn't robust enough for reliably storing massive amounts of data over long periods of time, even if in a mirrored configuration (and especially in a RAID5 configuration). Mainly due to bitrot and lack of checksumming. Granted, it was the best thing around for a long time, but not any more.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the only \"cross-platform\" file system I use is ZFS, presented via CIFS by Linux running in a VM. (I'm also increasingly using BTRFS which recently seems to have crossed some threshold of stability for my use cases. For a long time I only used it experimentally and it often let me down.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't use ZFS for Mac OS, only ZFS on Linux. (I used to use an OpenSolaris VM to host ZFS for the sake of purity and support for the most up-to-date ZFS features, until Oracle messed it up.)</p>\n\n<p>I tried ZFS for Mac a while back and it was too unstable and outdated. Maybe it's fine now, but my VM solution is flawless. And like I said, I'm increasingly using BTRFS anyway, which is a better match in many ways for my requirements (the first and foremost of which is rock-solid reliability - which ZFS has always provided).</p>\n\n<p>I triple-boot my Macs, and when I'm not running Linux natively, I run the same native Linux installation in a VM. Linux is perfectly happy alternating between running in a VM with guest additions, and natively. I'm almost always running a Linux VM for \"native\" ZFS or BTRFS volume access via CIFS, when not running it natively.</p>\n\n<p>I've seamlessly adjusted most of my workflows to accommodate the slower CIFS access to large \"cross-platform\" reliable storage. For example, if I need fast access to lots of working data, it's usually in an application that is unique to that particular host OS, and it doesn't need to be accessible across platforms. So I just use whatever fast local SSD storage the OS is available natively, and make regular copies to the slower \"cross-platform\" storage - or only when the project is done, depending on the specific use case.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: If you do go the VM route, you'll be tempted to share the VM file system via a bridged adapter. The advantage to that is that the VM will have its own IP address on the same subnet, and the storage will be accessible even by other computers on that subnet. However, the drawbacks to a bridged adapter are 1) It is tied to a specific physical adapter and if you switch from, say, wired to wireless, you may lose internet connectivity from within the VM [which is only a problem if you are also using the VM as your productivity OS, as I usually do]. And 2) Bridged adapters can be finicky. Sometimes it \"just works\", but if you have problems, troubleshooting can be pretty messy. A better solution is to configure the VM with two adapters: A) NAT [for internet access from the VM which will work no matter what physical adapter is providing it], and B) Host-only, configured with a static IP address, no DNS or gateway, virtio adapter, and with promiscuous mode. Only your local machine will be able to access the VM's CIFS shares. It's not trivial to get this solution set up, but once you do it's basically magic.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n"

A year later, I may notice that the battery isn't holding as much power, and decide I want to benchmark it. I test it again, and find out that its still holding 5 hours of battery (it just seemed like it was holding less). So while it's less than the 7 hours promised by Apple, my battery hasn't actually degraded at all, since it matches the same benchmark I used before. Thus, there is no point of replacing its batteries.</p>\n\n<p>I have several programs running in the background (BetterTouchTool, KeyRemap4MacBook, DropBox, iAntiVirus), which I expect to be running throughout my MacBooks life.

Thus, I'm thinking an automated program which keeps using the battery at a consistent rate would be the best tool for the job.</p>\n\n<p>Also, how would I know how long the battery lasted? I don't want to sit near the computer and constantly monitor if it's still on or not. I want to be able to set it and forget it.

These basically use 100% of your CPU from the moment you turn the program on until the moment you turn it off. This drains the battery pretty quick.

My path to discovery as follows...</p>\n\n<p>I recently started noticing that fish shell completions were annoyingly slow on my machine, possibly shortly after upgrading to Catalina.</p>\n\n<p>I did a little profiling with <code>fish -d5</code> and noticed that the majority of the time was spent on the <code>apropos</code> command. I did some reading and learned that the tools <code>apropos</code>, <code>whatis</code> and <code>makewhatis</code> are all related. They index man pages and make them searchable. Fish shell is (correctly) using them to offer helpful completions.</p>\n\n<p>When I run <code>whatis</code> or <code>apropos</code> standalone, I get the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ whatis man\nhugo-gen-man(1)          - Generate man pages for the Hugo CLI\ngroff_man(7)             - groff `man' macros to support generation of man pages\ngroffer(1)               - display groff files and man~pages on X and tty\nman(1)                   - format and display the on-line manual pages\nman.conf(5)              - configuration data for man\nzshall(1)                - the Z shell meta-man page\nxml2man(1)               - MPGL to mdoc (man page) translator\nmakewhatis: /usr/lib/./libgutenprint.2.dylib: No such file or directory\nmakewhatis: /usr/lib/libsasl2.2.0.1.dylib: Not a directory\nmakewhatis: /usr/lib/libldap.dylib: Not a directory\nmakewhatis: /usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib: Not a directory\nmakewhatis: /usr/lib/libcom_err.dylib: Not a directory\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Followed by <strong>at least 100 more lines</strong> of the \"Not a directory\" messages.

How can I rebuild the whatis database? I have a hunch this will solve my issues if I can figure it out.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>The following can be used as a workaround for the macOS 10.15.1 version of the apropos command, wherein it spews out complaints of the form <code>makewhatis: /usr/lib/lib … .dylib: Not a directory.</code></p>\n\n<p>First create the workaround script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/workarounds\n$ sed -e 66s@/usr/lib@@ /usr/bin/apropos &gt; ~/workarounds/apropos.macos_10.15.1 \n$ diff /usr/bin/apropos ~/workarounds/apropos.macos_10.15.1 \n66c66\n&lt;     for d in /var/cache/man $manpath /usr/lib\n---\n&gt;     for d in /var/cache/man $manpath \n$ chmod +x ~/workarounds/apropos.macos_10.15.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next add an alias to your shell to tell it to use the workaround script, until a newer version of the canonical script becomes available.</p>\n\n<p>For Zsh you can use the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /bin/cat &lt;&lt;END &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\n# Workaround for broken apropos command.\nalias apropos=~/workarounds/apropos.macos_10.15.1\nEND\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For other shells such as ksh or bash, use ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile, as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the workaround do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apropos requests (and man -k requests) are handled by the <code>/usr/bin/apropos</code> script. That script searches for “whatis” database files in all the directories of the man path (see <code>man —path</code>), plus <code>/var/cache/man</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code>. The checks for <code>/var/cache/man/whatis</code> and <code>/usr/lib/whatis</code> appear to be there for historical reasons, however those files are not actively generated in Mojave or Catalina. A lot of different people have contributed to the various flavours of Unix over the years, and many of them had different good ideas about where to put different types of files. At some point in time, somebody decided that <code>/usr/lib</code> would be a good place to put a whatis file, and at some other point somebody else figured that /var/cache/man would be a good place. Others thought that the appropriate place would be the respective man page directories. Different solutions that seemed appropriate at the time. The apropos script has traditionally checked those locations in case a whatis file was present.</p>\n\n<p>With the move to making the system directories on Catalina read-only (a good move), whatis database files can not be written to directories such as <code>/usr/share/man</code>. There are different ways that Apple could handle that, but for this release somebody decided to alter the apropos script by making it generate results on the fly by calling <code>/usr/libexec/makewhatis.local</code> for any man page directory that does not contain a whatis file.</p>\n\n<p>That new apropos code works fine for actual man page directories, and for <code>/var/cache/man</code> (since it doesn’t exist), but it fails for <code>/usr/lib</code>. The workaround detailed above just eliminates <code>/usr/lib</code> from the list of directories searched.</p>\n\n<p>As a final step, set yourself a reminder for a month or two from now to check whether Apple has fixed the apropos script. If so remove your workarounds, by removing the alias and the workaround script.</p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>I recently updated my 2015 iMac to the new OS (10.15.7) and at times it becomes incredibly sluggish to the point of not being able to do any productive work. It sometimes takes 20-30 seconds just to click a button; sometimes opening a web page takes minutes. I recently gutted the computer in an attempt to speed it up, and before updating the OS it worked really well. To download XCode I had to download the new operating system, and after downloading it the Mac has slowed down considerably, even though the CPU usage stays very low.</p>\n<p>It seems to be getting worse. Yesterday I was able to run the iOS simulator and it wasn't running too poorly, but today the simulator wont even start up. I've tried restarting the computer. I just don't understand why my mac has become so sluggish even though the CPU isn't being fully utilized whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Why would my mac run slow if the CPU usage is very low?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>There are a number of possible reasons for sluggishness after an OS update. The OS update is usually not the cause, but often the 'catalyst'. The chain of events leads many to believe incorrectly that &quot;the OS update killed my Mac&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Hard disk failure.</strong><br />\nInstalling a new OS involves writing several GB to the disk. If your hard drive is several years old, then this work may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. A disk may continue to 'work', but be slow.<br />\nLow CPU usage but poor performance does sound like a disk problem.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Incompatible software.</strong><br />\nOlder third-party software may not work well with the new OS. This is particularly true for things that 'get their hooks' into the OS, running background processes or low-level IO tasks. Things like hardware drivers, system monitors, or anything that changes the behaviour of the OS are usual suspects. Look in <code>/Library</code> (and <code>&lt;user&gt;/Library</code>) folders such as <code>LaunchAgents</code>, <code>LaunchDaemons</code>; also <strong>Login Items</strong> in the <strong>Users &amp; Groups</strong> System Preference pane.</p>\n<p>You can test this by performing a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh21245/mac\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Safe Boot</a> , which will start your OS without any of these third party software. Restart normally after testing. Performing a Safe Boot will also clear some caches, which may help. (Though wildly emptying all caches will in fact cause some slowness as the OS attempts to rebuild them all!)</p>\n<p>Another useful test is creating a new user account and logging into that. If things works well there, then you know the problem is something in your original user account, and not the OS itself or the hardware.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>I'm a network admin at a school, and I'm wondering if anyone here can shed some light on an odd problem. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Preface</strong>: We have a number of laptop carts of MacBook Pros and MacBooks as well as over 100 faculty MacBook Pros. We have spent a lot of time teaching students and faculty members that when they wish to turn off a laptop, they must click the Apple, then Shut Down and then WAIT UNTIL THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK. As indicated by the all caps, this has been a major problem in the past because students and faculty alike will click Shut Down, then immediately close the lid, thus suspending the machine in a state between log out and shut down. After many years of data corruption, constant reminders and re-education, the problem is finally at an all-time low. However, all of that is now in jeopardy due to a change in Yosemite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: We are switching to OS 10.10 next year, and Apple has changed the shutdown screen from pure white to pure black, meaning the average user has practically no way to know when the machine is actually turned off. There is a small spinning progress circle in the bottom middle of the screen, but it is dull and almost imperceptible unless the brightness is way up and the environment is dark. This means that users will click Shut Down and then immediately close the lid once they see the black screen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Desired Result</strong>: In a perfect world, I would be able to set a custom shutdown screen that has text on it and is, you know, not not identical to a powered off screen. Alternatively, I could at least put large text on top of the black screen. I have not found any way to modify the shutdown screen for 10.10 or any other OS. Does anyone know any way to accomplish this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another Desired Result</strong>: It would be nice if I could replace the default spinning progress circle with something else that is bigger, brighter and actually visible. The only issue I see here is that the graphic is so small that regardless of what I created to go in its place, it would be ignored. If the graphic could be made larger, that would be a serious possibility. However, as with the above choice, I have not seen any evidence that it is possible. Does anyone know anything about this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Work-Arounds I've Pondered and/or Tried:</strong><br>\n1) <em>Changing the shutdown timer to 1 or 2 seconds.</em><br>\n-- I would like to avoid this if possible because of the issues that could occur if processes are constantly killed before gracefully ending. I realize this is not a constant issue, but it would happen. </p>\n\n<p>2) <em>Turning on the keyboard backlight.</em><br>\n-- This would technically work, because the keyboard backlight stays on until the machine is fully shut down. However, it is not practical. It drains the battery, not everyone wants it on, and there is no way to force it to stay on.</p>\n\n<p>3) <em>Informing users to pay attention to physical things, such as HD vibration, fan airflow, noise etc.</em><br>\n-- This is completely impractical, totally unreliable and would never work for the faculty, much less the students.</p>\n\n<p>4) <em>Somehow configure the system beep to make noises until the power is turned off.</em><br>\n-- I don't think it is possible to control the system beep that way, and besides, if there are more than two students in the same room there would be beeps all over the place and no way to know whose machine they came from. Also it would annoy everyone.</p>\n\n<p>5) <em>Run a logout hook script that displays something on the screen that goes away only when the power turns off.</em><br>\n-- I'm not entirely sure this is technically possible, because as the OS is shutting down, the processes that would need to be kept alive to run the message would either prevent shutdown altogether, or simply get killed as part of the shutdown process.</p>\n\n<p>6) <em>Use a program like NoSleep or InsominaX to disable the lid closing behavior.</em><br>\n-- When used in conjunction with completely disabling the ability to sleep and hibernate the computer, technically this functionality would work nicely for the laptop carts. However, it is not an ideal solution. The main issue is getting the programs to run reliably every time, which has not been my experience using them over the years. Secondly though, the program's menu bar icon would be visible and accessible to students; and they cannot be allowed to manipulate such settings.<br>\n-- Furthermore, teachers need to be able to put their computer to sleep, and these programs make that an unreliable process. In my testing, if you put a computer to sleep by clicking Apple --> Sleep, closing the lid actually wakes the machine up. I've put a ticket in with each developer, but a response is unlikely I think.</p>\n\n<p>7) <em>Add a command to a logout hook which turns the screen brightness up to 100%, create a LaunchAgent then returns it to 50% (or some other number) at boot up.</em><br> \n-- In theory, with some luck and a lot of re-education it could work for the faculty laptops, but it is highly unlikely the students would have the presence of mind to pay attention to the degrees of blackness necessary to make a power on vs. power off judgement. </p>\n\n<p>As you can see, I have put a lot of thought into this and done a lot of research, but so far I am still without a solid solution. I have found almost no references online to anyone making custom shutdown messages, or altering shutdown behaviors in the way that I am describing. What I have seen mostly involves changing the shutdown timer, commands for a dirty or forced shutdown, creating AppleScript to display messages to be clicked before shutdown begins, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone have any ideas how I might proceed here?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>To solve data corruption, have users log out. Also, empower users to know if their backups are current and make it their responsibility to self-service restore activities.</p>\n\n<p>To minimize restart times, have users restart the macs and sleep them when the login screen arrives (assuming you don't have auto-log in enabled). This makes much more sense to me since new classes should have everything prepped and the last class should clean up their mess. </p>\n\n<p>All your workarounds seem like IT taking the cleanup burden from the users and also shouldering the data protection lead. When IT is seen as a second fail safe to be relied upon when the routine maintenance and operating throw an exception, your life will be much better. In turn, the staff and student's lives will be much better since you can then support the real problems and not be self-selecting and volunteering for all the janitorial work.</p>\n\n<p>Also, having reboots be a monthly task is working well in most environments I'm aware of. If your software selection and testing is yielding leaky and crash-tastic performance, documenting that would be an excellent investment in the future so that the curriculum reflects the costs of maintenance since you are well aware of how real they can be when you don't have stable OS that can wipe things clean once a user logs out.</p>\n\n<p>When IT can be responsible for system stability and users responsible for user maintenance (log out and log in) and you can track reboots as a signal that users are not trained or that a quality defect has slipped past the testing group, life gets far more fun for IT.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, look at your MDM provider - with 150 macs under management, you'll reap significant benefits if you learn how to use that tool proactively. If you don't have one, start a bushel trial immediately and reach out to one or more vendors to learn how you can leverage tools to assist. Even if you end up rolling out scripts to tweak hooks, you'll want a solid framework for monitoring and change management rather than laying hands on every cart and interrupting staff constantly for inevitable changes and updates.</p>\n"

Another interesting thing I found was <code>pppd</code> but setting up the configuration file was very frustrating.

Since sleep doesn't log you out, everything still works.</p>\n<p>A related issue is that Bluetooth keyboards also don't work during boot up (never did for me). So if you ever need to go into recovery mode, you need a USB keyboard if the internal one breaks. I don't know how the Apple wireless keyboard bypasses all this, but I assume they cheat and use an unofficial extension to Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>If you pair to the Logitech dongle, it will all work as it is essentially a &quot;USB&quot; device.

Users can\n# add custom state by defining a shell_session_save_user_state function\n# that writes restoration commands to the session file at exit. e.g.,\n# to save a variable:\n#\n#   shell_session_save_user_state() { echo MY_VAR=\"'$MY_VAR'\" &gt;&gt; \"$SHELL_SESSION_FILE\"; }\n#\n# During shell startup the session file is executed. Old files are\n# periodically deleted.\n#\n# The default behavior arranges to save and restore the bash command\n# history independently for each restored terminal session. It also\n# merges commands into the global history for new sessions. Because\n# of this it is recommended that you set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to\n# larger values.\n#\n# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting\n# SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations\n# that arrange to share new commands among running shells by\n# manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include\n# 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is\n# enabled, per-session history is disabled by default. You may\n# explicitly enable it by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1.\n#\n# The implementation of per-session command histories in combination\n# with a shared global command history is incompatible with the\n# HISTTIMEFORMAT variable--the timestamps are applied inconsistently\n# to different parts of the history; therefore, if HISTTIMEFORMAT is\n# defined, per-session history is disabled by default.\n#\n# Note that this uses PROMPT_COMMAND to enable per-session history\n# the first time for each new session. If you customize PROMPT_COMMAND\n# be sure to include the previous value. e.g.,\n#\n#   PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here\"\n#\n# Otherwise, the per-session history won't take effect until the first\n# restore.\n#\n# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists:\n#\n#   ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n</code></pre>\n"

If you go this route, you’ll need to connect your New drive so Migration Assistant can pull the data (it won’t alter the New drive, it will read it only).</li>\n<li>(Optionally) Do not transfer any settings with Migration assistant and do it Manually after the install is over. This is good if you have problems in your profile, but it’s a tedious work if you had years of “stuff”. You can have Migration Assistant to <em>only</em> transfer your documents (to save you the trouble later), but if you transfer your “Network Settings” and your “Applications” any problem you had in the past may “come back” in those two. You can always <em>manually drag</em> the apps from new drive to Old drive after the install. And unless you also drag their ~Library/Application Settings stuff, they will be “brand new and unconfigured”. I believe you get the idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Option #2)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do the same thing as Option #1, except that instead of making a clone (and booting from it), perform a full Time Machine backup to that new external drive. </p></li>\n<li><p>Once you have the backup continue with step number 6 up there. Remember that Migration Assistant will have to be told to “migrate from a Time Machine backup” instead of “just another volume”.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Which one is better?</strong> \nThere’s no better or worse, but a few things must be observed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A full clone, although may seem tedious, it’s a <strong>fully working volume</strong> that’s identical (well, almost) than your original one, it boots, you can even work from there in case of hard drive failure, in no time you have your computer back. That’s priceless in some environments and under certain circumstances. The clones can later (daily, hourly, etc.) be updated and it takes a fraction of a second to update (just like Time Machine doesn’t make a full backup every time). SuperDuper is very good at that and was a pioneer at doing it right and fast™. </li>\n<li>A Time Machine, although a very nice and handy thing (and I do recommend you <strong>also</strong> have one once you have your working machine reinstalled and migrated), is not bootable and in case of total hard drive failure, you wouldn’t be able to start working immediately, because Time Machine backups are not bootable and the recovery process is somewhat slower and more prone to errors (in my humble experience).</li>\n<li>With that being said, Time Machine wins hands down when you “need to find that file I had on my desktop a couple of weeks ago”. Since Full Clones (and their incremental stuff) usually <em>do not keep history</em> of changes (CCC has some stuff about that, but the space used grows really fast), then you always have the “latest” copy of your drive, but you cannot go back to your drive the way it was “a month ago”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there you have the two main methods. </p>\n\n<p>An ideally backup plan (without going paranoid), will consists of a weekly (or daily) clone/snapshot to a bootable drive that you can store a few feet away from your computer every now and then and an “all the time” Time Machine drive sitting there, keeping your computer’s changes up to date in a short interval. This covers the two main problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I need last week’s file and I need it now! (Time Machine)</li>\n<li>My Drive crashed but I need to continue working now!

It's 5-7% louder than the 2015 version but its mid and high ranges are less detailed (not pleasant to hear comparing to the 2015, even w/o comparing it's obvious that something is missing, the low end on the contrary is too loud and bulky that ruins the whole balance. Also it tends to overload the sound volume so it can give you a harsh/cracking sound, so I'm disappointed in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>As for the 2018 version (12.9), again it sounds like from the closed barrel, does  not have enough mid and high range, the low range became even more punchier than the 2017 one, not pleasant.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>My 2012 27″ iMac is working quite well, even the fan doesn't behave strange as along as the computer is running or is in sleep mode. But it becomes strange when I shut down the Mac, because when the machine is OFF, the fan runs riot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is how I shut it down:</strong><br>\nI select the apple-symbol in the menu bar and click on \"Shut Down…\". After that I get a popup-window that tells me that without any further action the Mac would be shut down in 60 seconds (counting down). This window contains a checkbox where I can choose if I want to get all windows reopened after the next start (I don't want). I click on the right button that says \"Shut Down\". Then the screen turns black, and if I listen carefully I can hear some quiet noise form the harddisk, and after that I would expect that the machine would be completely off and emmits neither any light nor any noise.</p>\n\n<p>This is true for light but not for noise. In exactly that moment when I would expect the end of all activities, the fan starts to run at highest possible speed. I didn't even know that it can run so fast and blow out so much air. But it does. And it wont stop. Even if I wait more than half an hour the fan keeps running at highest speed. And the Mac is NOT hot! When I touch it, it feels as cold as any other peace of metal that has room temperature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The fan stops only in this two cases:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I physically disconnect the power cable. After doing so, I can wait as long as I want (I tried 8 hours during night). In the very moment when I reconnect the power supply, the fan instantly starts running at top speed and won't stop again (I lost patience after 20 minutes and then I pulled out the plug again).</p></li>\n<li><p>I press the on/off-button on the back of the lower left corner of the Mac. In this case the fan stops on the spot and the startup-procedure beginns and everything is fine.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The fan also goes mad after long time in sleep-mode:</strong><br>\nWhen I do normal work on my Mac (writing text, browsing in internet) I can hear the fan at a very low level. It is so quiet that I really must concentrate to hear it. When it is in sleep mode I don't even hear this low noise. I think the fan is stoped completely in this mode. But when the sleep-mode is lasting too long the fan jumps into high-speed mode too. I noticed this today morning. Yesterday evening I set the iMac in sleep mode by pressing the on/off-button on the back of the lower left corner. Then I was watching TV for aprox. 2 hours and then i left the room and went to bed. Fan was quiet at this moment. When I came back in the morning I found the mac with the fan running on highest possible speed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This happened before:</strong><br>\nThe day before yesterday I bought a new usb-hub. When the Mac was in sleep mode I connected the hub's UBS-cable to the mac and then connected the hub's power supply to the outlet next to the one where the mac gets its power from. Then I turned on the Mac and everything was fine. I worked some time on it (I guess 1 hour) then I pressed the on/off-button to send it to sleep, but this time it was different:</p>\n\n<p>The screen turned black as expected, but the mouse-pointer was still visible for aprox. 5 or 10 seconds. I didn't try to move the mouse in this moment, so I don't know if it would have reacted on mousemovement. Then also the mouse-pointer disappeared and everything was as expected. Then I was away for some hours and when I came back I tried to turn on the iMac by pressing the on/off-Button. But nothing happened. I tried pressing the button for a long time (1 min) and tried to press it fast in rapid succession but nothing happened. My iMac stayed off. So I pulled out the power plug, did wait for aprox. 1 minute and reconnected it (at this time nothing happened, also the fan didn't start). When I tried to press the on/off-button this time it did work. My iMac did start and worked fine. But since this episode the fan gets crasy when the machine is shut down. It does so with the new usb-hub connected but also without. The hub is working fine.

Your symptoms sure sounds like the SMC either is stuck in some loop and not reading the temp sensors. Failure to control the fans properly could also be a hardware issue where the SMC is receiving a signal where the correct action is to keep the fans not only spinning, but spinning at an elevated level.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>This autumn of 2017 when High Sierra is released, there will be far more concrete details and evidence for you to make an educated decision. I can’t conceive Apple won’t make clear the risks and benefits on consumer, support, professional and technical levels for APFS. My guess is most people should make one backup and then jump. If you have old software that cannot be updated, you might wait three months for any odd bugs to get documented or worked out if you can’t easily recover from a bootable backup or reinstall your apps at the versions you require. </p>\n\n<p>At worst, you can always wipe and reinstall High Sierra on HFS and then copy files from your backup (whether the backup is HFS or APFS or some other file system)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In July 2017, The migration scripts and functions are still being tested in beta - so today, there are no signs you could revert back from APFS to HFS on the beta macOS. Worse, you shouldn’t even trust the forward conversion yet for non-throwaway system test use. </p>\n\n<p>Many programs will not work yet on APFS formatted volumes. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bombich.com/blog/2017/07/07/pondering-conversion-from-hfs-apfs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://bombich.com/blog/2017/07/07/pondering-conversion-from-hfs-apfs</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would recommend keeping all your important data and all your system backups clean and untouched by beta versions of APFS scripts. </p>\n\n<p>What seems to work well even now in the beta is copying files back from APFS to HFS if I work on a file or photo in beta and want to keep it on my main system.

I think this behavior is more of an omission than a deliberate design decision, and checking &quot;Reduce Transparency&quot; in System Preferences&gt;Accessibility&gt;Display doesn't change how folders are displayed, that is, this is not caused by Desktop Tinting (more on Desktop Tinting below).</p>\n<h2>About Desktop Tinting</h2>\n<p>There is a new Mojave feature called <strong>Desktop Tinting</strong> that only is activated when using Dark Mode. Desktop Tinting slightly modifies the color of windows to match your desktop picture.</p>\n<p>If you want to <strong>disable Desktop Tinting</strong>, Graphite Mode will disable the color tinting altogether, according to, for example, Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/210/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introducing Dark Mode</a> WWDC 2018 Session and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/09/macos-10-14-mojave-the-ars-technica-review/#h7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ars Technica Mojave review</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find additional information about Desktop Tinting in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/210/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introducing Dark Mode</a> WWDC 2018 video (select the Transcript tab and search for &quot;desktop tinting&quot;):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[D]esktop tinting (...) causes the window's background colors to camouflage\nthemselves with the desktop picture.</strong></p>\n<p>We found that completely\n<strong>desaturated gray colors have a tendency to have a color temperature\nthat was sometimes in conflict with what your desktop picture was</strong>, and\nthis effect was magnified when you have a translucent sidebar area,\nfor example, against a solid opaque area of your window, and so\ndesktop tinting helps mitigate that.</p>\n<p><strong>Once applied, the desktop tinting\ngives the whole window a harmonious color scheme</strong>, which helps it to\nblend in with the surrounding areas and really reduces that color\ntemperature disparity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/09/macos-10-14-mojave-the-ars-technica-review/#h7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ars Technica Mojave review</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One separate but related feature exclusive to Dark Mode is called\nDesktop Tinting, which goes beyond the translucent sidebars and other\nUI elements.</p>\n<p>Each window samples an “average” color from whatever\npiece of your desktop wallpaper it’s on top of and uses that color to\nsubtly tint every single window in the operating system.

So I am confused that you appear to have described what might be a different script entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The script also has a number of qualities about it that irk me a great deal, such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Its lazy usage of <code>try</code>...<code>end try</code>; </p></li>\n<li><p>The insertion of literal single quotes surrounding a variable being used as part of a string, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>do shell script \"find '\" &amp; SortFolder &amp; \"' -type f\" \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of</p>\n\n<pre><code>do shell script \"find \" &amp; quoted form of SortFolder &amp; \" -type f\" \n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>This</strong> bizarre formulation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if text (length of text of DroppedFolder) of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which could be written as </p>\n\n<pre><code>if text -1 of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or as</p>\n\n<pre><code>if the last character of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or even </p>\n\n<pre><code>if DroppedFolder does not end with \"/\" then...\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>And</strong> repeated use of <code>do shell script</code>, which is fine as a command tool to be invoked thoughtfully when needed, but when it populates the script as densely as it does this one, one wonders why the script wasn't just written as a shell/bash script to begin with.  It's also very costly in terms of overhead to create and destroy shell processes one after another like this script does.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given these stylistic and functional drawbacks, plus the confusion over what the script is supposed to be doing currently versus what it actually appears to do, I felt it warranted a re-write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>use Finder : application \"Finder\"\nproperty rootdir : missing value\n\n# The default run handler when run within Script Editor\non run\n    using terms from scripting additions\n        set root to choose folder\n    end using terms from\n    set rootdir to Finder's folder root                         -- '\n    sortFiles()\nend run\n\n# Processes items dropped onto the applet.

In fact, the worst case scenario is the same as with your current script, which is the situation where you choose the wrong directory by mistake.  Assuming the correct directory is selected, then the worst case scenario is that files don't get moved, so it's generally a very safe script.</p>\n\n<p>I re-wrote the <code>open</code> handler too, to (hopefully) allow it to cater for multiple items being dropped onto the applet.  This means you could, for example, drop two folders onto it and have both folders' contents re-structured.  However, I haven't tested this.  Again, the worst case scenario here is that it doesn't do anything, which will be the case if I am wrong about what type of file reference gets passed to the <code>open</code> handler (I assume it will be <code>alias</code> objects).</p>\n"

There is important data on this disk and it cannot be lost.</li>\n<li>I also have an external 256GB usb hd that's currently formatted NTFS with some windows stuff on it but could be easily formatted for whatever purpose.</li>\n<li>I love me some hot terminal action ;)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://wiki.onmac.net/index.php/Triple_Boot_via_BootCamp\">this guide which is a bit outdated</a>, but I think the fundamentals should still apply.</p>\n\n<p>After reading this guide, my plan was to get 2 4GB sticks of ram, a new SSD, install that as the primary drive and load Lion onto it.  Exactly how, TBD, you tell me the easiest way.  I would then move the current internal HD to an <a href=\"http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/\">opti-bay expansion like this one (but maybe not exactly this one)</a> and have two internal disks.</p>\n\n<p>With the new hardware in place, the SSD would be one partition, guid partition table (EFI), osx 10.7 only.  Then, if I understand things correctly, I could partition the second HD with MBR and install Linux on one half and Win7 on the other half.  Presumably, I would need to use <a href=\"http://refit.sourceforge.net/\">rEFIt</a> to see all three in the menu.  This guide also talks about Windows having to be the final partition on the disk, I don't know if that still applies if it's the second drive?</p>\n\n<p>Any extra space I could mount from external disks after getting the environments booted, but it's my understanding that you <em>have</em> to boot from internal drives.  So far any attempt I've made to boot from external linux usb sticks and live cds have all failed, but it could be to me not blessing or formatting things properly.  I honestly think I did things correctly, but I'm not perfect and I could have done something wrong or missed a step.  I've tried Apple's own Disk Utility, <a href=\"http://www.pendrivelinux.com/\">PenDrive</a> and <a href=\"http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\">unetbootin</a>.  I've also burned Fedora 16 and CentOS 5 live cds and had no success booting either.  Both of them dump me into my existing Windows (oh the irony) when I boot with C or use option and select the cd.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if this is even possible, and you've done this, I have a ton of questions for you.  Primarily, how would you suggest a plan of action / order of things I should do so I have a checklist I can run through to get the installations going.  However, I'd also like to know more information about any snags you ran into, drivers needed, kernel modules, x11 configs, distro hacks, or anything else you've run into with linux on your macbook.  I've read some horror stories about high-pitched speaker squeal and things like that.  Everything from precisely what distribution you used to what window manager, no detail is too small.  </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend I got my internal SuperDrive to read, not write.  Don't ask me how or why please.  I'm not quite sure what I did, I just jacked around with different CD-R DVD-R media.  I'm guessing it's still on it's last leg, but it is having an easier time with this new media.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

It appears to cover everything from the special things needed during install to getting the light sensors and other internal do-dads working post-install with respective drivers.</p>\n\n<p>The main points to overcoming the challenge:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install all the bits before the upgrade to the existing HD by booting from the internal CD</li>\n<li>When installing linux install Grub to the PARTITION, not the device, but since that's fruity you've got to set a few flags on the files to make sure the blocks don't move around on you afterward</li>\n<li>After things are installed, remove the superdrive and put in the new HD and install Lion to the <em>second</em> drive <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5823096/how-to-burn-your-own-lion-install-dvd-or-flash-drive\" rel=\"nofollow\">using a USB disk install procedure</a> then boot into Lion off that.

I plan on leaving it alone while I can, but probably two or three months from now wiping it out once I'm confident my Lion workspace is completely functional</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Only real potential trouble I can see with this is that if anything goes sideways I've no longer got the internal super drive to boot from which seems to be a necessity for the third-party OS installs.  As I said, OSX dvds will boot just fine from the external firewire BD-R.  Perhaps having a usb-enclosure for the superdrive would work?  I'm just guessing since USB tends to be much more broadly supported than fw.  Worst case scenario I open it up again and rip out the functional drive and re-insert the SuperDrive for the repairs, then remove it again, but I can see this potentially causing headaches with device ids and such, particularly in linux where things will reference /dev/sd*  If anybody can confirm they have booted a third-party os install from an external USB stick or USB superdrive enclosure I would feel much better.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>New partition scheme for those interested:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Mac                     200.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Linux                   10.0 GB    disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows                 109.6 GB   disk0s4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the <code>Apple_HFS</code> next to linux, I specifically formatted this HFS before the windows install so that Windows would not pick it up as C during the installation procedure.  During the Linux install procedure I'm going to format with ext3 or ext4.  </p>\n\n<p>Order of installs is OSX, Win, Linux.  OSX boots from EFI, Windows boots from MBR, and Linux is chain loaded from EFI (refit) to boot from the partition.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2:</p>\n\n<p>The latest ArchLinux bootable ISO could not boot properly with the default parameters.  It would hang infinitely waiting for UDEV UEVENTS.  The newer ISO's apparently ship with an open source nVidia driver that blows up on at least a couple of MacBooks.  I turned the module off at boot by pressing <code>Tab</code> instead of hitting enter and appending <code>nouveau.modeset=0</code> to the vmlinuz load parameters.  This allowed me to get to a root shell.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: </p>\n\n<p>I ran into some trouble getting refit to see Linux after the installation. The installer would only install grub to the device, so I had to manually install my boot loader. It was a bit tricky, and not really well documented in any of the linked guides so I'll attempt to capture exactly what happened. </p>\n\n<p>Installation went through fine, but when I selected Grub, it would only allow me to install it to the device. Knowing that I did not want that, I hit cancel and tried installing it manually.  Grub install failed at first. The trouble with that was since I only formatted the partition ext3 and did not adjust the partition table, the Linux partition was not flagged as bootable. So, I had to tweak and re sync.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>From the install cd, drop to an alt console with FN+alt+f2 and run <code>parted</code></li>\n<li>From the GNU Parted console, flag the partition bootable by doing <code>toggle 3 boot</code> for me it was 3 since it was /dev/sda3 </li>\n<li>This jacks your partition table, so, <code>exit</code> to get back to bash and <code>shutdown -h now</code> then, with a fresh set of electrons, boot into refit console and run <code>gptsync</code></li>\n<li>With GPT and MBR now in sync, reboot yet again into the install cd</li>\n<li><code>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt</code> to get back into your hard drive</li>\n<li><code>grub-install --root-directory=/mnt --recheck --no-floppy /dev/sda3</code> to install grub to the partition </li>\n<li>Go double check <code>/mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst</code> to see if everything is ok.  For me I ended up having to add the /boot prefixes on the file paths</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To try to summarize, neither formatting ext3 nor installing the boot loader to the partition was enough, I needed to touch the partition table to get refit to see it was out of sync and adjust things.  I am now successfully triple booting SL, Arch, Win7.  I have yet to install the second hard drive.</p>\n"
