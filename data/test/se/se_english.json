Of course compound adjectives are hyphenated (second expression), but in the first expression, exactly what parts of speech are \"20\" and \"meters\"? Is \"20 meters thick\" a predicate adjective that is not hyphenated because it's a predicate rather than an attributive adjective phrase that precedes the noun \"layer\"? Is \"20\" an adjective? This is so intuitive that I can't articulate the rules behind it -- but I need to for a scientific colleague.</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>Perhaps a clearer way to explain the distinction might be to compare \"It's a 20-meter-thick layer\" with \"The layer is 20 meters thick\"—which is the sense of \"It's 20 meters thick\" once you identify the intended referent for the pronoun <em>It</em> that appears at the beginning of that sentence. With </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The layer is 20 meters thick.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>we know what the subject is from the outset because the writer opens the sentence with it (\"The layer\"). So all that remains in the predicate is the modifier of the subject that we encountered at the beginning of the sentence: The layer is thick. How thick? 20 meters thick. There is no point in hyphenating the modifying phrase here because the predicate is simple enough that the sense of its components can't easily be misunderstood.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, with</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's a 20-meter-thick layer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don't know what the pronoun <em>It</em> refers to until we reach the last word of the sentence, where <em>layer</em> appears as a predicate nominative, and \"20-meter-thick\" modifies it. For the reader, unraveling the sentence involves working through this path: It's a layer. What kind of layer? A 20-meter-thick layer. Here some writers would hyphenate \"20-meter-thick\" to make immediately clear that that part of the predicate forms a modifying block for the predicate nominative.  </p>\n"

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>I have actually never related both words together, but coincidentally, I realized that in germen, \"art = Kunst\" and \"artificial = künstlich\", namely people do relate both concepts together. So how is the word <em>artificial</em> derived from <em>art</em>, although they have quite different meaning?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>The answer lies in the middle, in <em>artifice</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Definitionally</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Artificial</em> is the adjectival form and means something's fake, but <em>artifice</em> specifically refers to using intelligence, skill or a stratagem to outwit someone or trick them into believing something false. The connection to something fake is there but it's shifted to beliefs and connected now to the skill that generated the false belief.</p>\n\n<p>Dictionary.com references an obsolete usage of <em>artifice</em> as \"craftsmanship\". Art is a specialised craft, often visual. So it's easy to see a connection now between <em>art</em> and <em>artifice</em>, a craft in appearances (deception in the sinister case), and <em>artificial</em>, as something that bears the hallmarks of an artifice.</p>\n\n<p><em>Artificial</em> also connotes man-made - something to replace the organic. This is something they all share: a painting is a man-made depiction (traditional paintings, landscapes or portraits, stand-in for the real experience) and an artifice is obviously a man-made strategy. This need not be negative, as the idea of \"fake\" implies, but one can see the relationship between \"crafting\" something, being fake and getting increasingly distant from the category of \"organic\". <em>Artificial</em> might be compared to the word <em>superficial</em> in being about surface/immediate perceptions but something superficial implies an emptiness whereas something artificial just has a different composition (but some sense of loss of the \"real\" thing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parallel</strong></p>\n\n<p>An almost identical analogue of art -> artificial is <em>craftiness</em>. Craftiness both means someone's humble, creative skills with tangible mediums (positive sense) and one's ability to deceive others with a clever strategy (negative sense), i.e. a \"crafty person\" is cunning because they bend a situation to their advantage like a craftsman, artisan or artist bending their preferred material into a new object. So, a craft (art) is a skill in making something, craftiness is the ability or extent to use that skill and somewhere along the lines <em>craftiness</em> was used metaphorically for mental skill in deceiving others, probably euphemistically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dictionary.com and Merriam-Webster both cite the Latin <em>artificum</em> and <em>artifex</em> as etymological roots, composed of the Latin <em>ars</em>, which means skill and is almost identical to the word <em>art</em> (one of the websites explicitly said 'ars' was the Latin word for art). I believe \"art\" and \"craft\" had a more interchangeable usage historically as well which lends credence to the parallel above. I'm only speaking for the English here but I imagine the German will follow very similar if not exact lines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Historical context</strong></p>\n\n<p>The historical reasons for \"art\" even having negatively connoting derivatives is perhaps to do with an alternating culture of decrying and celebrating art as alluded. Classical art (realistic portrait/landscape painting) participates in visual appearance and therefore illusion to appear real. We could view this positively or negatively. Historically, painting (as emblematic of art) was seen as lesser to certain intellectual circles; to be an illusion is to deceive which is to deter from or distort the truth, the ultimate good or achievement of the intellect. Plato, for example, argues painting is lesser for having 2 degrees of separation from reality and thus from truth, and this carries throughout the Western philosophical tradition up to the German philosophers (!) 2000 years later saying music is the highest form of art because it's abstract/intangible (so it's intellectual and not \"base\" or \"material\" or \"illusory\"), compared to a painting. In this sense, painting (as emblematic of art) is by its very nature artificial, and so the link might be a lot closer than it at first <em>appears</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But it seems today's view of art is a lot more positive than that. We could say the skill required to make something realistic is impressive enough, much like how we revere classic painters now, or even to say that studying the world in this traditional, visual way of drawing and painting actually unveils truth about objects we wouldn't otherwise get (Leonardo da Vinci argued this in rebuttal to Plato!). Art itself has long-since evolved away from traditional portraiture/landscape to combat various conceptual issues like this (what's real? true? does it matter? etc.) and that's why, on the one hand, it might seem so bizarre to think of \"art\" as related to \"artifical\" today, since it's now come to refer to something broader or have a positive sense associated with it that's incongruence with the negative sense of \"artificial. Yet, on the other hand, the layperson finds a lot of contemporary art difficult to understand if not outright repulsive, partly because there's a background discussion they aren't privy to, but also because people come to art with different senses and expectations and a lot of contemporary art is deliberately non-traditional in its form. Some people come for the classic realism, to see something pretty to marvel at, which may indeed rely on \"deceptive\" techniques, while others, I suppose, want a conversation about life and reality and to see something new.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Artifice as \"exterior\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I had a strong conviction <em>artifice</em> had a specific meaning of \"an exterior\", but neither of the above sites showed that, nor did a 3-min Google search. This is despite the fact I've heard the expression of \"a building's artifice\" to talk of a building's exterior, an entrance, facade or <em>image</em> of the building, often pretty. If this definition is valid, it would strengthen my point because I can make the step from art to architecture and artificial via being a decorative enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>It's funny how we can have such a positive reference in the word \"art\" and then have derivations of completely opposite usage.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>tldr: What’s written is ok, and I’ll show you what it means.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Grammar is something that falls out of the spoken language, not the written one. Punctuation is unrelated to grammar except in that rare circumstance when it signals an audible intonation change meant to alert the listener to some change in the actual underlying grammar. Those cases are hard to come up with, but do exist. All punctuation is just cues for hearing the real language in your head better.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore by that metric, not only is there nothing wrong with the punctuation as written, there cannot be, and no matter how it is written.</p>\n\n<p>So try saying your first example aloud in your head, which I will here write without commas because voices have no commas, just intonation:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It’s no use repeating the obvious <strong>things that</strong> have been said by others <strong>and that</strong> can be found in any encyclopedia.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a restrictive <em>that</em> here, which you can tell because it can be substituted by <em>which</em> with no change in meaning or permissibility:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It’s no use repeating the obvious <strong>things which</strong> have been said by others <strong>and which</strong> can be found in any encyclopedia.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can’t use <em>that</em> in descriptive clauses but we can use both <em>that</em> and <em>which</em> in restrictive ones, so if you can swap them, you know what you have. And the other way around, too. This is grammatical whether with or without its comma:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They always wake me at three in the morning(,) <strong>which</strong> really annoys me.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But this is ungrammatical again no matter whether you write the comma or not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They always wake me at three in the morning(,) <strong>*that</strong> really annoys me. [<strong>ᴡʀᴏɴɢ</strong>]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That one is wrong because it tried to use <em>that</em> for a descriptive clause, and you can only use <em>which</em> for those. The native ear goes HUH? when it hears it, which is what makes it ungrammatical.</p>\n\n<p>As you see, it’s never its punctuation which makes something grammatical or ungrammatical.  It’s whether you the right worms oops I mean words have managed to put together right — which this sentence almost did not.  Twice. :) It had almost managed not to put the right words together, twice.</p>\n\n<p>As you observe, we do not usually use commas before restrictive clauses in English because there is no intonation change to signal there.  Presuming that the writer was a competent one, this means the writer was trying to signal something else by including intonation dips.  I believe that what he was signalling was an apocopated version of two appositives, which I’ll use em dashes to set off with a repeated <em>things</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It’s no use repeating the obvious things — <strong>(things) that</strong> have been said by others — <strong>and (things) that</strong> can be found in any encyclopedia.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you read his punctuation there, the commas, as an indicator of appositives the same way as they’re used for that in this sentence, his pauses will make much more sense. It’s not especially common, so it’s no wonder it caught your eye, but I believe that there is a legitimate reading where it makes perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>As for this one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“That’s the person, if I’m not mistaken, that we were talking about.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here you have to read this for syntactic constituents. The phrase <em>if I’m not mistaken</em> is a parenthetical aside. It could have been written:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“That’s the person <b>—</b> if I’m not mistaken <strong>— that</strong> we were talking about.”</li>\n<li>“That’s the person <b>(</b>if I’m not mistaken<b>) that</b> we were talking about.”</li>\n<li>“That’s the person <b>(</b>if I’m not mistaken<b>) who/whom</b> we were talking about.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the commas are the same as parens or dashes: they’re there to surround the parenthetical statement. Since in the spoken language you cannot hear any punctuation, this cannot change the grammar. They’re just there to help the reader. </p>\n\n<p>These too are all ok:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>that we</strong> were talking about.”</li>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>we</strong> were talking about.”</li>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>who(m) we</strong> were talking about.”</li>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>about whom we</strong> were talking.”</li>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>about which we</strong> were talking.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All those are fine. About the only thing you can’t do is say: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“If I’m not mistaken, that’s the person <strong>about *that we</strong> were talking.” [<strong>ᴡʀᴏɴɢ</strong>]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because <em>which</em> cannot function there to start the clause to serve as the object of a preposition.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Don’t allow some simple, perhaps simplistic, mnemonic tip for good writing style such as “don’t use a comma before <em>that</em>” confuse you about the larger surrounding issues or about a sentence’s actual grammar. Such tips exist to break a common pattern in beginning writers unfamiliar with the conventions normally observed in these things. But rest assured that the actual <strong>grammar</strong> remains intact no matter the punctuation, for any grammatical error will jump out to your ear without seeing the punctuation — just like in my very last bulleted example sentence above, the one with the extra asterisk.</p>\n"

The writer means, \"[S]he left this world with zero regrets on time [she had] spent, places [she had] been, or people she [had] loved in her 29 years.\" You can see from the bracketed elisions of the past perfect helping verbs that the construction is not parallel. Technically, the last \"she\" in the series should be omitted to preserve the parallel structure; or the complete construction \"she had\" should be included in all three instances of the series, which would not only preserve parallelism, but also be clearer. No double-take trying to figure out what's what in the sentence. </p>\n\n<p>2) Perhaps this is only a regional or dialectical peeve, but I'm pretty sure \"with zero regrets <em>on</em>\" should be \"with zero regrets <em>for</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>PS I think the suggestion to add \"been <em>to</em>\" is awful.

He did some excellent homework on the origins (see above in his original question posting).</p>\n\n<p>It appears the word <em>may have</em> originated after being coined in use by <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/copypasta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4chan's Anon community circa 2006</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I say <em>may have</em> because I'm still not convinced that it actually originated there; it may have but that's not entirely clear yet. However, let's just assume that's right. I would like to dive into how it may have come into existence (even if it did originate <em>there</em> - this is more about the \"why\" and \"how\").</p>\n\n<p>Without even checking the link above it is obvious that copypasta is a portmanteau of \"copy\" and \"pasta\". However, <strong><em>why</em></strong> did users begin to coin this phrase? RaceYouAnytime makes a great answer post about some findings on the use of the word; but I find the answer to Josh's post less about the nature of whether it's derogatory or not and rather more about why and how it came into use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PASTA HISTORY</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, some history. What does \"pasta\" have to do with anything? Well, back in the early days of computer programming many languages shared a feature known as a \"goto\" statement (which also required a label - you would \"jump\" to the label by saying \"goto begin-loop\", or some such thing. This created a mess of coding, especially if the coding was unplanned or ill implemented. By the mid 1980's or so we had a full fledged pejorative for this type of thing: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spaghetti Code</a>. It's mentioned as early as 1977 at a symposium, but it was not until around 1979 that we had a published version of the word. However, references to \"Spaghetti\" type coding go all the way back to 1968 (or at the least the beginnings of problems with \"goto\" type programming).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>COPY/PASTE HISTORY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a few years, maybe even up to a decade or so, and we also have the rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"copy/pasting\"</a>. Technically it goes back to as early as 1975-1980 but it was not pervasive until the 1980's, even the later 80's.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>THE INTERNET AND SPAM</strong></p>\n\n<p>By the mid 1990's the inernet and \"web browsers\" were catching on very quickly, email use began to proliferate, and <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SPAM</a> had begun to be a serious issue. It gained a definite pejorative sense extremely quickly. I mention spam here not only because of it's reference in the OP's post but because the internet and tech culture has a long and storied history of using food and various other items to describe derisive and unwanted terms and/or to create portmanteaus.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>SO WHERE DID COPYPASTA COME FROM, OR RATHER, WHY DID WE BEGIN USING IT?</h2>\n\n<p>I believe it began as a way to combine the pejorative's of \"spaghetti code\" (noodles or pasta) with the unwanted and intentional copying/pasting (or SPAM-like activity) into a portmanteau that embodies both concepts. It's a word the community came up with to describe a way of \"noodling\" or \"jumbling\" the content of sites by casually copy/pasting information all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>The internet, and the rise of forums, social networks, memes (more about that in a moment), etc... gave way to a culture in which we create new words all the time. It makes sense too. In the last 40 years we have seen more innovation than the entirety of human history (which goes back, arguably, from 300k-500k years for \"modern\" homosapiens). We need these words. But internet subcultures, which up until roughly 10 years ago (best case), were composed of people who by their nature were curious, innovative, and looking for more compact ways to express ideas. This has always been the aim of the programming elite and various techy subcultures. </p>\n\n<p>It's in this way that I think the word came to be. This was likely the communities way of saying, <em>\"stop copying/pasting things all over because its noodling up our site and adding no value [as it can be found elsewhere with a simple link]\"</em>. I would imagine this was the case because it's likely that a subset of programmers or techies started the use of the word, especially as far back as 2004-2006, and I would imagine they were combining the concepts of spaghetti code (or pasta) and the idea of SPAMMING (which was being done by blatantly copy/pasting everywhere) to create the portmanteau: <em>copypasta</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I think the mixing of the words, <em>copy and pasta</em>, into a portmanteau is very similar and analogous to how the phrase, spaghetti code, came into existence. It seems highly likely with the early internet culture's obsession with Monty Python skits, which were, at least partly, the fuel for the usage of food items (such as SPAM) to describe undesirable actions, that this is how we came upon, <em>\"copypasta\"</em>. This would be my overall hypothesis.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EXAMPLES OF INTERNET OR TECH ORIENTED ITEMS RELATED TO FOOD</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm not going to include an exhaustive list but there are some I can think of right away. I'll include items from this discussion as well for completeness:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>copypasta (obviously - the discussion of this post)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Creepypasta</a> (a similar type of word)</li>\n<li>Spaghetti Code (see links above)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?RavioliCode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ravioli Code</a> (This is a term that came about much, much later with the growth of something known as \"Pair Programming\" and Agile practices. Basically what happened is software design went through a paradigm shift and programs went from something known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">functional or structure top/down coding</a> to a more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"loosely-coupled, object based\" design</a>. This allowed for easier extensibility, maintainability, and efficiency. The term refers to the <em>\"bite size\"</em> pieces of <strong><em>Ravioli</em></strong> which are like the \"methods\" we use in object oriented programming today and refer to it's loose coupled nature.)</li>\n<li>SPAM (see links above)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTP Cookies</a> (web cookies) </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_cookie\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magic Cookie</a> (also likely the root/origin for modern internet cookies)</li>\n<li>Java (the programming language)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Beans</a> (another variation on the Java language)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechSoup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TechSoup</a> (an organization started in 1987)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/09/50-stunning-examples-of-the-droste-effect/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Droste Effect</a> (a Dutch term for a specific type of recursive picture - recursion is a CS topic beyond the scope of this entry - but what is interesting about this is that \"Droste\" is a reference to Droste cacao and hot chocolate products)</li>\n<li>Apple Computers (founded late 1970's)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Again, there are others, this is just what I thought of right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>And this last one I have set aside for special consideration:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"Hash\"tag (#)</strong>. Everyone knows this today from Twitter but the concept of hashes and/or hash \"marks\" have been around forever (they go back to the very beginnings of Computer Science theory).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is not conclusive at all (<strong>fair disclaimer</strong>) but it is another hypothesis of mine that the many, many decades long use of the word hash, hash tables, hashing, hash trees, hash graphs, hash functions, hash maps, hash keys, etc... could have ultimately come from the food item <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_(food)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Hash\"</a> (a meat dish chopped up in bits in various configurations depending on locale). </p>\n\n<p>In fact the interesting thing is that if you look at a hash mark (the common \"pound\" sign - another indication it <em>may</em> have roots in food), <strong>#</strong>, it resembles, potentially, a dish that has been cut up into pieces for serving. This is just something I find very interesting but I would need to do more research to give it a fair level of confidence.</p>\n\n<p>And it's not just foods either. I could fill pages with the various acronyms, portmanteaus, compound type word structures or phrasings, etc... that have been created in various tech subcultures throughout the decades. One's which either have a certain assonance, onomatopoeia, or metaphorical ring/tone. It's literally endless as far as that goes. Interesting stuff :)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>MEMES</strong></p>\n\n<p>I said I would mention meme's and I want to just briefly mention it because it's amazing to me how this word became so popularly used today. It doesn't necessarily relate exactly to the question but it's tangentially important to understanding this overall concept. Meme was a scientific word. It was a word that anthropologists and social biologists used to describe social viral concepts. \"Meme\", as it is used today is another example of how the true meaning of a word can change, how internet culture can affect its purpose, and even radically change the intention. </p>\n\n<p>Meme as used today, by most younger people, just means a picture/GIF with some very catchy, funny, phrasing on it - usually one that has had <em>viral</em> success. That is how that word mutated to what it is today. As opposed to it's original intent which was rooted in anthropological and biological studies to understand how ideas/concepts are shared among a culture, and passed from generation to generation, like a \"virus\". I think it's an important and great example of how we see words come into being, change meaning, or, at least change meaning within certain contexts (the meaning has not totally been lost in this case). I would like younger readers to understand that \"meme\", and how it relates to \"viral\", are so very close in meaning and relation to each other but they did not actually describe the <em>same</em> process originally. The concept of something \"going viral\" is almost directly borrowed from \"meme\". But a \"meme\" to most young people is a thing that has become viral (not the <em>mechanism</em> by which social viruses are transmitted - which is closer to it's original scientific purpose). I <em>guess</em> we <em>could</em> say that the GIF (or now even YouTube videos) is the memetic mechanism for information exchange and viral phenomenon. But most young people don't understand that interpretation. It's a brave new world :) We live in a constantly evolving soup of words and euphemisms :) </p>\n"

A. Richards defined metaphor in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Practical_Criticism_A_Study_Of_Literary/LVd8CgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Practical Criticism</em></a> (first published 1929) as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A shift, a carrying over of a word from its normal use to a new use. In a sense metaphor the shift of the word is occasioned and justified by a similarity or analogy <em>between the object</em> it is usually applied to and the new object. In an emotive metaphor the shift occurs through some similarity <em>between the feelings</em> the new situation and the normal situation arouse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Richards is building off of critics going as far back as Aristotle, who said in his <em><a href=\"http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/401s07/arismeta.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Poetics</a></em> that metaphor involves applying a name that customarily belongs to another kind, operating as an analogy. For both of them, metaphor is a kind of analogy.</p>\n<p>Metaphor may occasion the creation of new idioms and cliches, or it may create a connection, based in some similarity, that goes beyond the literal use of words. Superficially, this supports your notion that they are <em>creative</em>: they rely on lateral associations or abstruse patterns to work.</p>\n<p><strong>Second, it is odd to separate <em>analogy</em> from metaphor</strong>. Sometimes <em>analogies</em> are explained more restrictively as a specific form of similarity, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Analogies_Test\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">analogies</a> that occasionally appear in standardized tests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A is to B as C is to D</p>\n<p>Apples are to fruit as onions are to vegetable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, analogy is quite broad in meaning and seems to stand in for any kind of comparison, so that lots of authors don't even bother to define it. Here's Nilli Diengott in &quot;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42946196\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Analogy as a Critical Term: A Survey and Some Comments</a>&quot; (1985):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basis of analogy in literary criticism is resemblance or similarity between two terms. (228)</p>\n<p>Analogy is a <em>syntagmatic</em> (combinatory) principle. (228)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is lots more detail to provide on kinds of analogies, but its basis is comparison or connection, and both simile and metaphor are forms of analogy. For that reason, analogy should be grouped just below comparisons.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, it is peculiar to deny the creative or lateral potential of simile</strong>. I. A. Richards again, this time in <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/5Yw9l7j4HRkC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Principles of Literary Criticism</a></em> (1925):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who naturally employ metaphor and simile, especially when it is of an unusual kind, are said to have imagination. ... It should not be overlooked that metaphor and simile - the two may be considered together - have a great variety of functions in speech. (188)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It makes sense to treat metaphor and simile together when explaining imaginative potential. Similes also create lateral connections between things. Such lateral thinking is not contrary to analysis, but rather a frequent companion to it, as an effective comparison can analyze or &quot;break down&quot; a hitherto unrecognized relationship.</p>\n<p>What, then, makes simile differ from metaphor? Similes are directly marked with <em>like</em> or <em>as</em>, as M. H. Abrams explains in <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Glossary_of_Literary_Terms/o9VkYJuVn9YC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Glossary of Literary Terms</a></em> (first published 1957):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a simile, a comparison between two distinctly different things is explicitly indicated by the word &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as.&quot; (119)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Abrams and many others, the difference between this and metaphor is in the explicitness of marking comparison. Emphasis mine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a metaphor, a word or expression that in literal usage denotes one kind of thing is applied to a distinctly different kind of thing, <em>without asserting a comparison</em>. (119)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nothing prevents simile from being creative. Rather, the poles of your chart might be labeled &quot;explicit indication of comparison&quot; and &quot;implicit comparison.&quot; There are lots of nuanced little debates and wrinkles to find beyond that, but that'll get you through a reading or lecture that applies these concepts.</p>\n"

Kim became president of the World Bank in March 2012. The excerpted paragraph appears in the midst of a longer response to a question about the involvement of the Dartmouth Center for Health Care Delivery Science in relieving the post-earthquake health crisis in Haiti. Here's the full question and answer, for context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sullivan:</strong> I think a tangible example of that [Kim's interest in encouraging Dartmouth students to go into the field of global health] is what is going on in Haiti right now.  Partners in Health has been there, is still there.  Is that the kind of influence we could see more of in the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Kim:</strong> Well you know the Haiti project was based on a ‘once in every 200 years' disaster.  The earthquake just devastated a country that could least afford it, the country that could least afford it in the western hemisphere.  and the response of Dartmouth students and faculty and the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center has been extraordinary and we kept it up, especially now with the cholera outbreak.</p>\n<p>We are continuing to support efforts in Haiti and I think that will continue as long as we are helpful but we are not going to be in the business of going after every disaster in the world.  There are many other colleges and universities and organizations that do it much better than we do.  This was something that was quite spontaneous. Really wonderful to watch, but it is not a pattern that we are necessarily going to repeat in every country that has a disaster.</p>\n<p>I also think that what our students get out of the arts and humanities is critical for them to develop a sense that is much bigger than the quantitative aspects of a problem to understanding human complexity.  So, I think every day we are preparing young people to tackle the troubles of the world.  I don't think that John Sloan [D]ickey ever meant that we were going directly fix the troubles of the world. I think what he meant and what I quote him as saying is ‘The worlds' trouble are your troubles.' But since the worst troubles of the world come from the hearts of men and at that time there were only men on campus, there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings can not fix.</p>\n<p>So, some of the things that we do like the healthcare delivery science are going to be directly useful. But what we really do is: we are about building the better human beings who are going to tackle those troubles in a way that we have never seen before.</p>\n<p>I think the critical piece to building those human beings is a broad liberal arts education where you get really in-depth in subject matter but then you also study Greek literature and you also study philosophy and you are forced to take a studio art class. Those are the kind of human beings that I think the world needs to tackle the world's troubles[.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sloan_Dickey\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">John Sloan Dickey</a>, whose name appears midway through the crucial paragraph, was president of Dartmouth from 1945 to 1970, and was noted for his sensitivity to social issues outside the walls of academia. During his tenure as college president, he founded various programs that attempted to connect Dartmouth students to real-world problems of the time, and I get the impression that Kim saw himself as following in the tradition of Dickey's activism.</p>\n<p>According to a January 27, 2007, article in <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Evox/0607/0122/dickey.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vox of Dartmouth</a> (which calls itself &quot;The Newspaper for the Dartmouth Faculty and Staff&quot;), Dickey in a 1946 convocation address told students:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The world's troubles are your troubles...and there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It thus appears that Kim was riffing on that quotation with the WCAX interviewer. Unfortunately, the point, nature, and extent of the original quotation got garbled by the interview transcriber's handling of Kim's parenthetical remark about the all-male student body of Dartmouth in 1946. To put it bluntly, the transcriber utterly failed to represent that portion of Kim's remarks accurately, owing to a spectacular misapplication of simple punctuation marks.</p>\n<p>Here, I think, is how the transcriber should have rendered the paragraph in order to make Kim's meaning reasonably intelligible:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also think that what our students get out of the arts and humanities is critical for them to develop a sense that is much bigger than the quantitative aspects of a problem, to understanding human complexity. So, I think, every day we are preparing young people to tackle the troubles of the world. I don't think that John Sloan Dickey ever meant that we were going [to] directly fix the troubles of the world. I think what he meant, and what I quote him as saying, is ‘The world's troubles are your troubles. But since the worst troubles of the world come from the hearts of men'—and at that time, there were only men on campus—'there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The crucial changes in my version are (1) the use of em-dashes to break out the parenthetical phrase &quot;and at that time, there were only men on campus&quot;; (2) the extension of the quotation beginning &quot;The world's troubles are your troubles,&quot; so that, instead of ending there, it continues all the way to the end of the phrase &quot;hearts of men&quot;; and (3) the resumption of the quotation to encompass &quot;there is nothing wrong with the world that better human beings cannot fix.&quot; To accomplish these things I introduced the following changes in punctuation: (a) two new em-dashes, (b) a relocated close quotation mark, and (c) an additional pair of quotation marks. As Mari-Lou A observes elsewhere, I could have used parentheses instead of em-dashes to achieve goal (1) above, but in this particular situation I like the visual jolt of the dashes.</p>\n<p>The point of Kim's interpolation about there having been only men on Dartmouth's campus in 1946 wasn't to emphasize that the world's troubles come from the hearts of men (as opposed to the hearts of women) and therefore that better human beings (women) can fix the world. Rather, it was to defend retroactively (and anachronistically) Dickey's use of &quot;men&quot; to mean &quot;human beings&quot;—on the shaky grounds that he was addressing an audience composed entirely of male human beings.</p>\n<p>It's an odd tangent to go off on, but it's the sort of thing that people say in unrehearsed interviews. The much more serious problem here relates to the radio station's transcription of the spoken interview. The transcriber should have noticed that something weird was going on toward the end of that paragraph and should have done a little research to figure out who John Sloan Dickey was, what he had said, and what Kim was trying to say about those two things. That may seem like a lot to ask of a humble interview transcriber, but it took me only 15 to 20 minutes of online research to work out what was going on, so I have little sympathy for the inadequate job the transcriber did.</p>\n<p>One thing that we can all take away from this episode is a renewed awareness of how important punctuation is and how potentially harmful it can be to a correct understanding of a person's transcribed remarks. Though punctuation may not be a matter of grammar, as we often read on this site, it can produce completely misleading grammatically correct statements when incorrectly applied to a person's spoken words. So don't take it lightly: In writing, punctuation is an extremely powerful and often underestimated tool in an author's (or editor's or transcriber's) hands.</p>\n"

The phrase <em>lībra pondō</em> ‘a pound by weight’ was then used to refer unambiguously to the second meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The second word in that phrase, <em>pondus</em> ‘weight’, was borrowed from Latin into some stage of Common Germanic at some point, but in the narrowed sense of <em>lībra pondō</em>—i.e., cutting off the ‘wrong’ half of the sentence.

The meaning of an &quot;attributive&quot; construction is vague: it tells you that the head noun is of a &quot;type&quot; that is somehow related to the attributive noun, but it doesn't tell you the nature of the relationship. &quot;Baby oil&quot; is oil for using on babies, but &quot;olive oil&quot; is oil made from olives.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apposition\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apposition</a>,</em> a construction where two noun phrases that identify the same entity but in different ways are placed next to each other.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attributives</h3>\n<p>&quot;The <em>Star Wars</em> movie&quot; is an attributive construction: it brackets as &quot;the [[<em>Star Wars</em>] movie]&quot;, and means something like &quot;the movie of a type related to <em>Star Wars</em>&quot;.

The execution of such an accord bars further litigation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Compact</em>, meanwhile appears in a much larger cluster with <em>contract</em>, <em>bargain</em>, <em>pact</em>, <em>treaty</em>, <em>entente</em>, <em>convention</em>, <em>cartel</em>, <em>covenant</em>, <em>concordat</em>, <em>indenture</em>, and <em>mise</em>, under the general heading <em>contract</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Contract, bargain, compact, pact, treaty, entente, convention, cartel, covenant, concordat, indenture, mise</strong> designate an agreement reached after negotiation and ending in an exchange of promises between the parties concerned. ... A <strong>compact</strong> is an earnest or solemn exchange of promises, sometimes between state or political groups and often between persons.A compact may be unwritten or undocumented, the only assurance of its execution being the trust which each party places in the word of honor of the other or others. The word is used when a keen sense of the obligation which it imposes is assumed of each of the parties. [Examples omitted.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Black's Law Dictionary</em> (1968) takes a broader yet more formal view of the meaning of <em>compact</em> than <em>Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms</em> does:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>COMPACT,</strong> <em>n.</em> An agreement; a contract. [U.S. court case citation omitted.] Usually applied to conventions between nations or sovereign states. [Definitions from hornbooks and case law:] A contract between parties, which creates obligations and rights capable of being enforced, and contemplated as such between the parties, in their distinct and independent characters. [Source citation omitted.] A mutual consent of parties concerned respecting some property or right that is the object of the stipulation, or something that is to be done or forborne. [Source citation omitted.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <em>Black's</em> acknowledges only the \"resolution of an injury\" meaning of <em>accord</em> (the meaning that <em>Webster's</em> discusses in the final two sentences of its commentary on <em>accord</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ACCORD,</strong> <em>n.</em> A satisfaction agreed upon between the party injuring and the party injured which, when performed, is a bar to all actions upon this account. [Citations omitted.] An agreement to accept, in extinction of an obligation, something different from or less than that to which the person agreeing to accept is entitled. [Citations omitted.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most significant difference in meaning between <em>accord</em> and <em>compact</em> as applied to international agreements seems to be that an accord is in some sense preliminary to the final agreement binding the parties; it is an affirmation that, in principle, the governments engaged in negotiation have reached broad agreement on the resolution of the issues before them, but that at least some details remain to be hammered out. A compact, on the other hand, is an exchange of specific agreed-upon commitments more clearly in the nature of a binding contract at international law.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>English normally puts an adjective modifying a noun or noun-phrase before but adjacent to what is being modified. Therefore, the normal sense of \"_ has recorded an ever-growing collection of original pieces\" is that the number of original pieces in that collection is growing. Thus, I think it very unlikely that it could be interpreted as referring to increasing fabrication of physical items that encode performance of some or all of that music, or as referring to an increasing number of performances that have been recorded.</p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about possible confusion among original pieces of music, performances, or physical media, you could substitute \"write\" or \"record from\" for \"record.\"</p>\n\n<p>What does sound off to my ear is a slight mismatch between the tense of \"has recorded\" and the denotation of \"ever growing.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'd suggest \"_ has been recording from an ever growing collection ...\" That phrasing suggests that the process of recording started in the past, but has not necessarily ceased, a state of affairs perfectly consistent with a still increasing collection of original music.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I am less concerned with the use of \"record\" as a root verb as I am by the tense chosen.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>The English verb <em>will</em> is related to the noun <em>will</em>, which is one's capacity to want or wish to do something. Originally, the verb had a meaning similar to <em>want/wish</em>, as it still does in Dutch: the verb <em>willen</em> means \"to want\". </p>\n\n<p>Then at some point its meaning began to partially shift from desirability to probability: <em>he will do it</em> means \"it is highly probable for him to do it in the future\" rather than \"he wants to do it now\". It is common for <strong>probability and desirability to be somewhat fluid</strong> and shift around in all European languages I know.

        "golden_answer": " <p>The eastern third of Texas has a number of rivers that lie in plains with very gradual changes in topology. As a result, sedimentary deposits tend to build up fairly quickly. Dredging the mud makes the rivers deeper (and therefore more navigable), and it provides earth for various purposes such as dikes, levees, and erosion control. When I was growing up in Houston, a huge dredging operation in Galveston Bay provided vast amounts of mud to shore up the 5-mile-long, man-made Texas City Dike about 50 miles east of Houston. The project took many months to complete. </p>\n\n<p>Dredging is a major undertaking, and in some regions (perhaps including Texarkana, which sits near a huge bend of the Red River) dredging machines may be kept in continuous operation somewhere in the vicinity. It wouldn't be surprising to see a place near the river where a dredging machine was located referred to as \"out by the dredge.\" </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't assume that any habitation \"out by the dredge\" is necessarily impoverished and ramshackle, though it certainly might be. The main drawback of a house in such a location isn't that it is appreciably hotter or swampier than a house in any other neighborhood of a city built on a vast floodplain, but that it is considerably noisier when the dredge is in operation. The other problem is that it is likely to be more vulnerable to floods. </p>\n\n<p>Without more information about the person's living quarters, I would take the description at face value: the guy lives on or near the river, out by the dredge.</p>\n"

The earliest reference I could find was from 1945, but clearly alludes at a historical context around the phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<strong>Liar liar pants on fire, Nose as long as a telephone wire!</strong>\" sang Fenella to the timeless scornful tune of childhood. \"Anyway I'm not black,\" said Christine. \"Anyway I'm not white,\" said Fenella. \"So!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xxqqh.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xxqqh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=8t0hAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=liar%20liar%20pants&amp;dq=liar%20liar%20pants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAz_eWpNLUAhVEaD4KHZQ-B7IQ6AEILjAB\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Harper's Bazaar, 1945</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Overall, this collection of references still seems to suggest that the phrase, in some form or another, was used in verse before any sources I've been able to locate. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While I have no direct evidence of a link, the rhyming line \"nose as long as a telephone wire\" suggests a possible allusion to the popular and widely translated children's novel <a href=\"http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/72810000/72810000_pinocchio.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em></a> (<strong>1881-1883</strong>) by Carlo Collodi, where, as most readers probably know, the marionette Pinocchio's nose grew each time he told lies.  </p>\n\n<p>Following this line of speculation, it seems worth noting that at three points in the novel, Pinocchio is threatened with burning as firewood.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He swam on and on. After a while, he turned around again\n  and called louder than before:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Good-by, Master. If you ever need a piece of good dry firewood,\n  remember me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n"
