My body and appearance will become increasingly feminine over a matter of months. At some point, I will officially change my name. </p>\n\n<p>My current plan takes me into an industry that isn't great to trans folks on the whole.

Hence, my reasoning is I should not share information that will only hurt me. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Talk to my recruiter after I receive an offer</strong>: The advantage is I'm gambling on only one person. I don't need to communicate it to the entire team, so it is less likely to spread.

        "golden_answer": " <p>Congratulations on pretty much everything about this!</p>\n\n<p>You may be able to find some kind of employee resource group to reach out to. You could ask if there's any sort of LGBT group, and ask <em>them</em> the actual questions. That does mean sort of vaguely outing yourself, but then you can save the trans-specific questions for the folks you hopefully get referred to. If the company is too small there may be no such group (or not a formal enough one for your contacts to be aware of), but then it's hard to generalize about culture anyways. You <em>might</em> also be able to work toward good contacts for this by asking about things like organized volunteering.</p>\n\n<p>(I know where I work this would be <em>incredibly</em> helpful - there's a great group, and there'd be plenty of people willing to talk to a prospective new employee.)</p>\n\n<p>Failing that, my next inclination would be to try to get a one on one chat with your hiring manager (or maybe someone from the team you'd join), and try to gauge their attitudes. If it's a sufficiently friendly, social chat, you don't necessarily have to out yourself for that; you may be able to work your way into it, e.g. by mentioning a current event, a volunteering experience, or a trans friend or someone you admire. If it's in person and you're comfortable with it at this point, you could also just present a bit feminine and try to gauge reactions. </p>\n\n<p>This is definitely more difficult, of course, because you ideally want to get a <em>lot</em> of information out of gauging attitudes. If it seems positive initially , you may want to progress to more specific questions and try to pin things down. The difference between token and genuine support is generally quite obvious - the former will come with few specifics and often some non sequiturs or flat out mistakes - but the more you ask the more you know! Still, I would try to avoid giving too much personal detail, because while it may be obvious down the line anyway, it's nice to retain that option to let things remain unsaid. For example, I'd ask about gender neutral restrooms, but not say anything about what restrooms I intend to use at what point in my process.</p>\n\n<p>You may also be able to ask about some official policies without revealing anything, for example by asking to see the employee handbook, or health insurance policies. This unfortunately will only be able to tell you things at a very impersonal level, though; there's a big difference between policies on paper and day-to-day behavior.</p>\n\n<p>If it's sufficiently feasible, you could try to do all of the above: learn about the overall company, others' experiences there, <em>and</em> the team you're joining. In the end you'll care about it all: the overall company can provide structural support (restrooms, insurance) while the people you see daily are the ones who can have the most direct impact. And there can be a lot of variation across a company, so an overall good place can have both welcoming and unwelcoming teams. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, in terms of whether to ask, my personal advice would be to err on the side of caution and try to get whatever information you can up front. If the people you'll be working with are kind and understanding about these things, it can make your life immensely better, and if they're the opposite, it can make you miserable enough to leave your job. It is <em>absolutely</em> worth finding a good fit. My team has been solid and my manager has been incredible (thank you thank you!) and I can't imagine doing everything I've done without that support. (You could try to accomplish this by just promising yourself that you'll just leave if it's not working for you, but that sounds much more difficult to me both in terms of emotional burden and job-hunting.)</p>\n\n<p>Ideally I would do all of this once you actually have an offer. Partially that's just to avoid spending time and energy before you know, but it's also about protecting yourself against possible bias from whoever you're talking to. Of course if the whole company has bad attitudes then missing an offer would be no big loss, but it'd be a shame to miss out because of one person.</p>\n"

In this search, I've found a company that wanted a very long second interview (4+ hours) that must start early - obviously cutting out a big chunk of my work day because I also lose the time driving there and back. Taking off this time would mean that I basically couldn't do any other interview during that week as I wouldn't be able to make up the hours that I would need to.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this time commitment to a position I wasn't highly interested in after the first interview, I passed. But, they just recently offered to give me a call to discuss the company and hopefully get a better impression, and then split the interviews up so I can make it significantly easier.</p>\n\n<p>That all sounds well and good. However, I'm skeptical (or paranoid). This is sending up red flags for me. I'm in a major city that is a huge center for software development, and while I feel my resume is strong, I am at about 5 years of development experience - I have no illusions that I am a unique snowflake. Basically, I struggle to believe that my own skillset is why they're so flexible about making the interview process work, and committing that much time to a candidate that only passed a 1 hour technical phone screen.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To clarify, my concern is that I am surprised a company would be willing to adjust for a candidate that isn't at a senior level.  I'm trying to figure out if this is either a good sign (because the company is flexible and understanding) or a bad sign (because the company is desperate for qualified employees, because of high turnover or other faults).  Since I am relatively inexperienced, I'm looking to tap into the experience of more seasoned individuals to learn from their insight.</p>\n\n<p>Is this really a red flag, or am I simply worrying too much?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>It sounds like there are two things that are good signs to me.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>They must think that your qualifications make it worth the extra effort for the chance to have you add you to their team.  </p></li>\n<li><p>They are respectful of your time restraints and willing to adapt to your needs.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are qualities that I find highly attractive in a prospective company.  That does not mean that the company will continue after you are hired on, However, my experience is that companies that are not flexible and respectful in their on boarding process are also not flexible or respectful of your time in their day to day operations.  For that reason these are positives to me.</p>\n\n<p>I would also guess that they are having trouble finding the right candidate for this position.  It could be that they are looking for a rare combination of skills/experience.  I would guess that if this is the case, based on your resume they think you may have that combination or something that they can work with.  It could also be that the reality of the position may not live up to the expectations of their prospects.  But the only way to find out is to have the interview.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably you were interested in the position at some point.  If you still are I think there is little reason now not to at least try the first interview.  You should be able to get a feel for the company from it and make a decision at least if you are interested in future interviews.  In the end even if you go through all the interviews and get an offer that is not what you are looking for, or even just decide the position is not for you, there is little lost in proceeding with the interview if you are interested in making a change.</p>\n"

What should I do to be sure my work and efforts are noticed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are two completely different things, so step one: stop conflating them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I really don't want to be in a situation where the people who are doing less stuff and are less invested than me are more rewarded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No one wants to be in that situation. Everyone is in that situation. So step two: Get used to it, and stop caring.  The question that should be on your mind is not \"do my undeserving no good slacker coworkers deserve their bonuses?\" The question on your mind should be \"am I getting an adequate compensation for the amount of work I'm putting in?\"  The answers to those two questions have nothing to do with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way: the only way to control what bonuses your slacker coworkers get is to sabotage and badmouth them. Do you want to work at a company that encourages that kind of behaviour? Worry about what you're getting, not what anyone else is getting. Make yourself look good by enabling everyone around you to share in your success. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm not really good at communicating and asserting myself </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Step three: get better at both.  <strong>Once you are past entry level, software engineering is about communication, not writing code.</strong> You will not rise in your profession until you are able to communicate clearly with everyone in the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Write more emails. Write more design documents. Write a blog. Answer questions on StackOverflow. Volunteer to give talks internally or to the public. There are lots of ways to practice communications.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a junior engineer at Microsoft I was given a joke award -- a singing fish -- for being the guy on the team who wrote the longest, most detailed, most technical and most complete responses to design and implementation questions. It was a cute joke and I took it in the humour that it was intended, but it was also quite serious. That silly achievement was no accident; I deliberately set out to be known in the company as the guy to go to when you had a technical question about JavaScript, and <em>that got noticed</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What should I do to be sure my work and efforts are noticed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start at the technical level. Are your tasks tracked in a change management system?  Are your code changes tracked in a source code management system?  If not, you have bigger problems than recognition. If they are, then you can use these as the basis of a weekly report on what you've accomplished this week and what you plan to accomplish next week. </p>\n\n<p>Do you have code reviews? If not, again, you have bigger problems; start encouraging a culture of code reviews. Code reviews are a great way to showcase your work to your management and peers.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have status meetings?  Talk about what you've done in those meetings, where you're stuck, and how you can help other people get themselves unstuck.  Do you have skip-level meetings with management? If not, start taking your manager's manager out to lunch a few times a year.  Ask them if you are on track for your career goals, and if not, what you can do to improve. This effort will be noticed.</p>\n"

Out of curiosity I asked them to show me their tasks, and I was amazed at how much manual work was being done.

This was one of the easier tasks, but nevertheless I figured all of them could be automated using python scripts.</p>\n\n<p>After I wrote one script which worked just fine on my home computer, I told my coworker he would have to install Python on the work laptop / computer, but because our company policy required permission before installing software, I would have to ask the IT manager. He refused to allow it, citing reasons such as \"if you leave the company, who'd maintain the code in case a bug arises\", etc. There are probably also reasons such as him not trusting me as he and his team won't really understand the code and could think I might divuldge company data.

        "golden_answer": " <p><strong>Maintainability</strong> - This is a big issue. You said this was a large corporation. What happens if you were allowed to deploy an automated solution to even just half of these tasks? How much time would that free up? From your description, it seems to be a lot. In that case the company might not be able to keep everyone busy with more of the remaining tasks. In which case it will fire some of the staff you've made redundant. After a while you move on, then your script breaks and suddenly they either need their old staff levels back or someone who can go through how knows how many python scripts and fix them.

Maybe there's an alternative technology that you could use to write these automation tools and that is understood by your IT workers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Turf wars</strong> - It's also possible that you're encroaching on other people's turf. You're taking on IT work while presumably not an IT worker. You're proposing automation tools that could put a bunch of people out of their jobs. Being able to downsize your department is only useful to a manager if they can take the credit AND keep their own job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accountability</strong> - Lots of organizations are hesitant to trust tools without a classic supplier. They want to be able to call a number and scream into the phone \"We've paid X$ for your stupid product so now YOU will fix it!\" You've mentioned they all work with Excel so I assume you're all mostly running Windows. You might have more success proposing tools based on Microsoft backed technologies like .NET or PowerShell even though there isn't really a support hotline for scripts you wrote yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Also in this category: Some organizations or individuals are distrustfull of automation in general.

Consider finding employment and then rather than proposing working from home to enable you to study propose a shift to part time instead. Not everyone will go for it - and it will require a bit of schedule juggling with university but it could be very beneficial to you and potentially to the company as well. I was once in very advanced discussions with my then employer to carry out a PhD research project that was also an internal project for the company and they were very enthusiastic about the idea (here in the UK at the time it would also have entitled them to some fun tax breaks which no doubt contributed to their enthusiasm!) so there are ways and means that don't involve burning yourself out or having a low-paying research assistant job that mans you can barely afford to go to classes.</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>From a personal experience standpoint, I feel like a poll / survey that pops up that I am forced to take about my mood would probably negatively impact my mood. You are basically asking people to stop what they are doing, reflect on themselves, and then report. That is a good amount of brain power and energy you are asking for, even if the survey is short and quick.</p>\n<p>The act of reflecting on one's own mood in and of itself is extremely difficult and sometimes taxing to many people. On top of that, the results of such surveys are controversial at best. Many scientists feel that self-reported surveys about mood and &quot;feelings&quot; result in a data set that is not consistently accurate and possibly misleading.</p>\n<p>Also, polls/surveys inherently give forced answers. The idea that you <em>must</em> fit in to one of them 5-10 sets of moods about a specific scenario / topic is not very realistic. People are complex and moods are extremely complex. People can feel both excited and apprehensive about something but surveys might not even have &quot;apprehensive&quot; as an option so the survey taker checks off &quot;nervous&quot; which is read entirely differently by an analyst.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you are truly interested in trying to understand the happiness of your employees, create an anonymous suggestion box. The good old tried and true method of typing up a suggestion and placing it in a box is always a solid solution, but since you are in the tech sector you could also create your own version of the &quot;WHISPER&quot; app that allows employees to post thoughts and ideas anonymously. You would be surprised what people write in those boxes at their place of employment when they know it is anonymous!</p>\n<p>If you feel you must, once you have a solid user base actually using your suggestion box app, you can then start putting up &quot;scenarios&quot; and ask people to comment on those. For instance, you can push a &quot;special notification&quot; to the app users asking them to give their suggestions about a specific event that recently happened, or a made or scenario, or even a person. This allows the employees to communicate in their own words which is much easier to infer inflection in and understand the basis of the individual writing the comment and why they are writing it versus a cold, hard checkbox.</p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<h3>re: reliability and validity of self reported assesments of mood/emotion</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/780/docs/schwarz_feelings-as-information_7jan10.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/780/docs/schwarz_feelings-as-information_7jan10.pdf</a>\n<a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/55956/1340_ftp.pdf?sequence=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/55956/1340_ftp.pdf?sequence=1</a></p>\n<h3>re: the taxing nature of recalling emotion or non-sensory experiences</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2509.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2509.pdf</a></p>\n"

Earlier, <a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/138623/does-management-has-a-spy-on-floor\">you were worried about a spy</a>.  Before that, <a href=\"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/138342/is-pointing-finger-in-meeting-consider-bad\">you were receiving comments from coworkers because you were accidentally being rude</a> again due to a miscommunication.

That, combined with the fact that an interaction that lasted a relatively short time (not sure what a quick fix is to you but I assume a few minutes) lead you to be so upset that you crashed your car, which is a hugely outsized reaction, leads me to believe there is a good chance that you're not reading your colleague's intentions correctly.</p>\n\n<p>If you are reading your colleague correctly and he really was enjoying your mistake, that's terrible.  But I would question whether there was potentially another cultural miscommunication taking place.  You said that your probation period is almost ending so I assume you haven't been there more than a few months.  Your colleague joined a month ago and is the same age so you have maybe 2 months more experience than he does.  And you say that you've been mentoring him which is an odd thing for someone with only fractionally more experience to be doing.  Is there any possibility that something you're doing accidentally, like the finger pointing from the prior question, combined with this odd dynamic has lead your colleague to feel like you're constantly condescending to him?  If so, that doesn't excuse taking joy in your bug but it might explain it.</p>\n\n<p>Is there someone at work that you trust that you can talk to about some of these issues to check your interpretation and to help you navigate the local culture effectively?

Sounds like your boss already made a decision, so you'll have to begrudgingly follow it.  That doesn't mean you can't talk to him about it.  Hopefully, you have 1 on 1s with them.  During the next one say something like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know there was an issue between Jane and Jill that you intervened\nwith.  Why was I not part of the discussion?  I found out the issue\nfrom Jane.  I want everyone to work together, but it's hard to manage\nmy team if I'm cut out when there is a problem.  <strong>Do you trust me to give my team tough feedback?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Listen to what your boss says.  The last line is highlighted because it's important to drive home you could have handled this, and likely without making Jane as upset.</p>\n<p>The reality is Jane will likely just stop getting coffee, so it may come up again.

If your peformance slips, she can ask you if you are having personal problems. If you aren't at work when you are expected to be there, she can ask where you were. If you appear to have personality conflict with another emoplyee, she can ask you to explain your point of view of the situation. If work is being delayed, she can ask why. If she simply needs to ask how much progress you have made since yesterday, she can ask that too. If she wants to know what roadblocks you are having in getting the work done, she is well within her rights to ask. </p>\n\n<p>She might even be asking you to lunch becasue she thinks you are having a problem with her promotion (which frankly it appears to me that you do based on what you wrote) and she wants to talk to you privately away from the office. Or she might want to enlist your help to overcome some workplace problem where she is meeting resistance. Or she might be feeling out everyone on the team one at a time which most new suprevisors tend to do to get a better picture of how people think and what they feel the real problems are.

However, you now have to impress her with your attitude and work, so start cooperating with her and start telling her about your accomplishments (You may think she knows since she was promoted from within, but honestly how much attention have you paid to what every other person on the team is doing that may not impact your immediate tasks? Her view is different now and she needs to see what you have done to give you the appraisal you deserve. Or you could assume she knows and get a satifactory instead of an outstanding.) </p>\n"

We're asked to submit our PTO request as early as we can, preferably at least 2 weeks in advance, and will be accepted or denied based on company needs. That all makes sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>One month before my birthday, I requested PTO because I was going to Vegas (I requested 1 day, the Friday for a 3 day weekend). I hadn't gotten approval or heard anything back so 2 weeks before my birthday, I followed up and asked if my PTO was approved. My boss then proceeded to say the following: \"We'll see how much work you get done in the next 2 weeks. If you get enough done, you can go.\" As I work in software development, we work in 2 week sprints. So basically she said \"Get enough done in this sprint and show me you've gotten enough done at our retrospective and you can go.\"</p>\n\n<p>I understand not being able to accept and grant every PTO request based on business needs, like \"there's an important deadline coming up\" or \"there are too many people taking PTO for this weekend\", but is it legal to deny PTO based on performance, and even more so hold my PTO hostage and finally only accept my PTO request the day before the actual requested day off?</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, this has already happened and has passed.

It could be that the project you're working on affects other upcoming projects or it was promised by a certain time frame. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but, in my experience, what you experienced is both common and legal.

When a Junior applies and gets a position that is beyond thier experience to handle, they usually get fired and don't get a good recommendation.

If you \"reword\" or otherwise alter your CV entry to make yourself appear to be more qualified than you actually are, you have committed fraud.

It can certainly be daunting, but it's not impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Age is only an issue if you make it one. Don't focus on the negative, focus on what you're able to control, and how those things can help you towards your goal.

Stop focusing on what you <em>don't</em> want.</li>\n<li>Research the entry level positions posted for the field you're interested in. </li>\n<li>Determine what criteria employers are looking for. The good news is, people who are hiring entry level people will not expect them to have a long (or <em>any</em>) employment history. That's why they're called \"entry level\" jobs - they're intended to give you an entry point when you're not already in the system.</li>\n<li>Once you've done some research on what employers are looking for in terms of your ideal first job, make a plan to get those things. You may or may not have them currently. But that's okay - none of us were born with the skills that got us our first job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you have a plan, stay focused on it. Cross things off one at a time. When you're at a point where you have a good percentage of the criteria addressed, start applying for jobs. Since you've been to school and have a degree, contact your school and ask if they have a careers program. Work with someone in that program to get practice interviewing and writing resumes. People who support students looking for their first job will be used to coaching you through how to write your \"first\" resume, even if you think it will be empty. Typically, this will involve focusing on things other than work experience - accomplishments you made in your classes, projects you worked on towards your degree, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing is to get yourself a plan and work towards it. The steps may be different depending on things none of us know (what skills you have, what type of job you want, what employers are looking for in your area, and so on) - so we can't write the plan for you.

Many offices require that the worker have a dedicated space (like a table and chair) and that they be marginally free of interruption - in particular not being the primary caregiver for small children.  Other offices may be OK with the interruptions of child care (particularly in an emergency) but want the worker to be very judicious in how they charge time with the recognition that each interruption is a context switch.</p></li>\n<li><p>what is appropriate and acceptable contact with you when you are at home?  Most work-at-home workers would <em>prefer</em> that their teams make contact with them just as frequently as if they were in the office (they are working, after all!) and don't want to be left out the loop.  But how and when to make contact can take negotiation - for example, my last heavily work at home crew used IM extensively and we could all see when someone was busy with a colored flag - so I'd know not to call or IM if my person was away or in a meeting.</p></li>\n<li><p>when is overtime appropriate?  It sounds like you feel you're really killing yourself for the project, but your boss doesn't agree.  Sometimes that comes to acceptable reasons for overtime.  </p></li>\n<li><p>what is efficient?  I've had plenty of cases where people who weren't working particularly efficiently then had problems meeting schedule.  It sounds like there's been plenty of blunt discussion over the challenges of the project, but one thing to check in with is whether you are aligned with the efficiency expectations here.</p></li>\n<li><p>are you as efficient at home as you are in the office?  What's required to balance any discrepancies?  Taking aside personal interruptions, in tech work there can be all kinds of glitches when working remotely - slow connectivity, issues with access to certain resources, a delay in receiving important communications.  Work with your boss to figure out the pain points and address them.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What's the problem?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd seriously start with taking that overtime rejection and asking the simple question - \"why didn't you approve it?\"  This may be a long and ugly (or short and ugly) conversation, but at least you'll know the rationale.

None of the paperwork so far seems to be related to formally accepting the position.</li>\n<li>I have a final interview scheduled on Dec 3rd for a company I think I would prefer more.  I'm suggesting a start date of Dec 16th for the contracting position (for legitimate reasons - overlaps with holidays and vacations, need to give full 2-weeks notice, and move to the area), though there might be some pushback from the hiring company.

        "prompt": "\n\nHuman: <p>First some context: I graduated college 3 months ago near the top of my class in Computer Science.  Instead of going on to work at Google or Facebook or some similarly interesting company (like many other top performers in my class), I decided to take the first opportunity that came to me and work locally.  I had a lot of reasons for this - no travel, burnt out on 60+ hour weeks, really needing a job out of college, etc.  The job did not sound difficult, but I wanted a job and I was assured that the work I'd be doing was \"more difficult than it sounds.\"</p>\n\n<p>The first day I arrived at work, I was told what I'd be doing for the duration of my employment and frankly, it turned to be exactly as (non)difficult as it originally sounded.</p>\n\n<p>Having been there three months, I can say my time was spent in a 70-30 split.  30% of the time, I did painfully trivial work.  For all intents and purposes, their idea of programming amounted to filling out x and y values on glorified CSS sheets.  The other 70% - and the part that really gets to me - was spent doing <em>absolutely nothing</em>.  For the first few weeks, I would make rounds to my supervisor and the other developers asking - eventually even begging - for some task to do.  The answer was always \"sorry nothing yet, hang in there.\"  Eventually I gave up on that, as it was clearly going nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after accepting a much more interesting and (hopefully) fulfilling job elsewhere, I gave my 2 weeks notice, because I believed it was appropriate to do so.  I mentioned that if they did not need me to stay for 2 weeks, I was okay with leaving early, though internally I was hoping they would simply let me go.  That was on Monday, and they have not made any effort to take it further.  In fact, they've done just as little acknowledging of my existence as they've done the entire time I've been here. All my files are in their git repo - in practice all I need to do to leave is hand in my key.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is, given that I'm doing exactly no work right now (and no one has any desire to give me any), is it inappropriate for me to tell them tomorrow that I've changed my mind and will be leaving immediately?  If so, what's a good way to say it?  I don't want to insult them, but I will not be putting my time here on my resume, nor will I be using them as a reference (how could I?  I've done no work).</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I can start my new job a week early if I want to, so time off isn't an issue.  My main motive for wanting to leave early is simply that it borders on physically painful to be forced to waste such inordinate amounts of time. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update: I spoke with my boss today, and basically said something to the effect of \"I have no tasks, is it really necessary that I stay?\" He seemed surprisingly fine with letting me go, but told me to talk to his boss, which I did.  His boss did not seem too thrilled about the idea of me leaving, but there's a chance that he might go for it.  I'll have to see what happens.</p>\n\n<p>I also feel inclined to respond to everyone's different opinions.  Hopefully the way I handled the situation was professional enough; it may not have been but that's in the past now.  In response to the assertion that I should have used to the time to develop new skills: I did.  I learned quite a lot while here, no thanks to any tasks they gave me to do, but there's still two issues I had with using this time.  First, I could not make anything and therefore I still was not producing anything valuable to my resume, and whatever I made still would not have looked as good as true professional experience.  Second, after a while (especially now), that has become difficult to do.  Not having the freedom to actually code anything makes learning about a language progressively more difficult (and less fun).</p>\n\n<p>As to why I took the job... there really isn't a good reason.  This <em>isn't</em> a start-up, it's a moderate size company that does work so boring that when I explained what the company did on interviews (not even what <em>I</em> did) some interviewers laughed and didn't even bother to ask why I wanted to leave.  </p>\n\n<p>It's hard to explain exactly why I took the job - I asked myself that quite a bit - and I think the simple answer is that the offer came at I time when I was really burnt out on school, and I really just wanted something easy.  In fact, I got the offer before I had really done any job hunting.  On one hand, I could have started off somewhere better to begin with if I had waited, but at least by taking this job I had income while looking, so I don't think I actually regret taking it.</p>\n\n<p>So, in conclusion, thank you everyone for the help.  </p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

I'm happy and everything seems to be going well except for the fact that the company has an \"open-door policy\". This means we have to keep our doors open, unless we have a reason not to such as meetings or conference calls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a problem for me as I'm very sensitive to noise to the point where I usually develop a migraine</strong> unless I block out sound with earplugs. When I first got here I had a solitary corner office where I kept the door closed to work in silence. I ended up being moved to another office with a new colleague. He's resisting closing the door and mentioned that I was actually moved because I always closed my door.</p>\n\n<p>I explain how noise is a medical issue for me and while my management and colleagues appear understanding they say there's nothing they can do: in this company closed door means \"don't bother me\". My suggestion to put up a sign on the door wasn't acceptable. I suggested heavy duty earmuffs as an alternative but they all believe that would also signal that I don't want to talk to anyone. Their solution is to use normal headphones and listen to music. But I can't always do that! Some times I can, and some times I can't, and I definitely can't do that when I'm reading (which I also explained to my boss and HR).</p>\n\n<p>This is my first job in industry and I'm very happy and wouldn't want to wreck it, but I'm unable to find a solution that will satisfy everyone. I don't want to sound pushy, and I don't want to sound like \"it's my right to have a quiet environment\".

And that makes it perfectly reasonable to push back against this.</p>\n\n<p>If you already talked to HR about <em>this specific issue</em>, go back to them. Otherwise talk to your direct manager or the account manager for the client. Say something like the following (key points to hit are emphasized):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I wanted to revisit something we discussed a while ago with regards to me closing the door of my office due to the background noise. Looking back I get the impression that you believe this to be a minor issue and I just prefer a private office but <strong>it's more serious than that</strong>. I have chronic migraines that are triggered by noise. I find that the background noise present in the office when the door is open is causing a crippling migraine attack [insert frequency of attacks here]. Now I obviously want to respect the company policy but this current arrangement <strong>just isn't working for me</strong>. Going forward <strong>I'm going to need to</strong> be able to work in a relatively quiet environment which probably means closing the door or using heavy duty earmuffs to block out background noise. You've highlighted your concerns about this solution but <strong>I believe that it should be fine if</strong> I just explain that it's an accommodation for a medical issue and if I put up a sign that people are free to interrupt me even if the door is closed or I have those earmuffs on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's the general script you want to run with. In the US you'd drop key phrases like \"reasonable accommodation\", \"medical condition\" and \"FLSA\", but you'd have to be able to back up your self-diagnosis with at least some kind of doctor's note. I assume that similar employee protections exist in Germany so you could bring those up. Any HR employee should immediately recognise the gravity of this situation from a legal standpoint once you make it clear how much you are affected by this situation.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I originally assumed you were contracted out to a client where this policy was set in stone, which tends to complicate these matters. Since this all happening internally and by your own assessment you struggle with building rapport with colleagues, it's indeed possible that they're using this as a way to get you to integrate in the team and, as enderland mentioned in his answer, to appear more accessible. They might not realise that this isn't a particularly good way of doing that given the detrimental effect noise has on your health. </p>\n"

In my current role, I have 26 days of PTO, 12 paid holidays, 5 paid sick days, and 3 days of paid volunteer time (I'm able to take time off work as long as I do volunteer work for a non-profit on those days). At a prior employer, I had 18 paid holidays, 36 days of PTO, and 5 sick days. I have a life to live and value availability of time off, so when I'm selecting jobs, I'm sure to evaluate employers on that basis. Others may feel differently, and may target employers who compensate in other ways, versus time off (advancement, or salary, or other things).</p>\n\n<p>If we assume your theory is true, and there are (on average) less days of PTO in the US, your question of \"why\" may have many different answers. While there is less regulation in the US than in some countries around paid time off, this isn't inherently a good or a bad thing, as it essentially means that PTO becomes another point of negotiation when working out the details of a job offer. Some people see this as an advantage, since it means they can push for what they want, rather than having their outcomes dictated by regulation. Other people want to be protected from potentially abusive employers and would rather work under a more highly regulated environment. Unions play a role as well, when they're able to act in a manner where they can collectively bargain with an employer to set certain standards for things like PTO.</p>\n\n<p>Further, Workers in the US also have protections in terms of being allowed to take time off for specific circumstances - for instance, if you have to take leave to care for a sick family member, FMLA protects your job under certain circumstances. And we have programs where people out on disability or for other reasons either have protection for their jobs or may receive (limited) pay while they're out. As such, these special cases don't need to be accounted for when an employer determines how much PTO to offer.</p>\n"

You've been working a regular job for more than two years now - and that's not an unreasonably short span of time for your first full-time job after graduation. Employers are not going to look at your resume and think \"maybe this guy would rather be contracting than full-timing?\" when you haven't done that since October 2011.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary: don't sweat it. Focus on doing a good job of promoting your skills and experience, prepare yourself with a good answer for the \"why do you want to change jobs?\" question, but don't stress about the fact that you did freelance work while studying and for a short time afterwards.</p>\n"

If they like you a lot, well-run companies can and will fast-track you through the process.

Always respect the boundaries of their department and their leadership structure, but make it clear what your group requires, and that it is a requirement, not a request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Track your deliverables from other departments.  Know what you're going to need, and when.

        "golden_answer": " <p>Well, change your routine so it involves learning.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine someone asks you to deploy a new server for a project, <em>and</em> you know that in this company, this sort of tasks is done manually. You spend the next hour creating the virtual machine and installing and configuring the operating system. The next day, another person asks you to create another server. Day after day, you do it, and notice that you're not learning anything.</p>\n\n<p>A different approach would be to automate the task. You do the manual deployment a few times, and then you learn about automatic provisioning and other stuff. Now, when someone asks you for a new server, instead of wasting an hour of your work, you barely run a command, and while the server is being created, you do something else.</p>\n\n<p>This “something else” could be actually be making your users' lives better. For instance, why would you make them wait for one hour for a new server? You start researching about the subject, and you discover Docker, which seems promising. You try it, and find that it responds to the needs of 80% of your users—the remaining 20% still need a fully-featured VM.</p>\n\n<p>And so, now that you implemented Docker, in most cases, the users can have their environment provisioned in seconds instead of an hour. They find it so great that you have more and more requests for provisioning new environments. That's boring! What if you could learn a bit of software development? In a matter of months, you can create basic intranet sites. They are not secure or particularly comfortable to use, but they do their job: instead of calling you by phone and asking to provision a new server, users may simply do a request through your site. They like it, and you have even more free time to do more great stuff.</p>\n\n<p>The result? When the company eventually collapses (and it has much less risk to collapse, thanks to this great system administrator who automated everything and make the system tasks much less expensive than before!), you have a lot to tell to the potential employers. Not only do you know a lot of new technologies, but you can also tell them how you changed the sysadmin culture in your previous company and how you lowered system administration costs for the company.</p>\n\n<p>“But wait!” you'll tell me, <strong>“How would I learn if I have no seniors to learn from in the first place?”</strong>—this is what most comments to the question are about.</p>\n\n<p>Learning from peers who are more skilled than you is a great way to learn. Not the only one, indeed, but it's still important to do it. This doesn't mean those peers should be at your workplace.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There is Stack Exchange. Here, I came across much more talented people than in any workplace where I've been previously. And the good part is that Stack Exchange is not limited to <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/\">software engineering</a>, or <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/\">servers administration</a>, or <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/\">security</a>, or <a href=\"https://ux.stackexchange.com/\">user experience</a>. It's all those experts, together, in all those diverse fields, and that's just great!</p>\n\n<p>Back to my Docker example. Imagine you search for your own how to reduce time spent provisioning new environments. You may find some techniques which reduce it from an hour to a few minutes, but if you're unlucky, you may miss the Docker option. However, if you ask on ServerFault how to solve the time problem you have, there are chances someone will suggest Docker as an alternative to your current approach.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are meetups and conferences.</p></li>\n<li><p>And blogs. Don't forget blogs. There are obviously skilled system administrators who love talking about the things they are doing. Learn from their experience.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I started my career of software developer as a freelancer. While it's a good opportunity to learn stuff by discovering a lot of projects, it doesn't necessarily mean that the projects you work on will actually be worth discovering, nor that you'll meet talented people. Personally, I did, but not every project was really worth it.</p></li>\n<li><p>In 2013, I was financially forced to spend a year in a company where there were no professional developers whatsoever. There were so-called coders who knew nothing about programming. Still, during this year, I learned a lot, both in terms of technologies and in terms of general software development skills, by participating on Stack Exchange, reading books and articles and going to conferences. The time I was spending in the company was a total waste of time; despite that, I learned a lot during the year.</p></li>\n<li><p>In 2014, I joined a different company. While there were a few people more skilled than I, we never had an opportunity to talk much. Still, thanks to the books and to Stack Exchange, I learned a lot as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now, I have a chance to work in a company where most people are more skilled than I.

There is no phone signal across the whole of the site or internet available.</li>\n<li><strong>Value</strong> - The course itself costs the business around 2 months worth of my salary.

Declining says <em>\"you're wrong, actually, that training is quite useless.\"</em> This is rarely a wise thing to say to your employer. It is for this reason I dutifully attended the \"business writing\" training all new hires got, after winning awards for my technical writing before joining the company.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it could in fact be useful. It's easy to hang around with someone else and be ironically detached and say you can't use those skills later or you already knew that. Try applying the advice <em>\"if you can't get out of it, get into it\"</em> and you may find you learn things.</p>\n\n<p>On the matter of your health and the long unpaid day of travel, if (and only if) the training is sometimes available more conveniently, it might be ok to ask if it is possible for you to take it when it's closer to the office or in warmer weather. But I have a feeling that inconvenience (in the form of distance, isolation, lack of distractions, not in the form of you getting sick) is part of the plan. If you truly feel the health issue is reason enough not to go when it's cold, then ask not to go when it's cold -- but if you go later it will be with different people, which could reduce the value. If you don't feel the health issue is in fact a showstopper, consider the very likely case that the general inconvenience to everyone is deliberate.</p>\n\n<p>The spartan accommodations, lack of phone and internet, and enjoyable activities tell me this is all supposed to be a \"team building\" thing that bonds the group while teaching you how to be whole and connected people.

I'd like to continue working all the way up until the day before my flight. I'm planning to spend at least 2-3 years away from the US. </p>\n\n<p>I've been in my current job for 7+ years and it's the only job I've had since I graduated college. I feel like I have an excellent relationship with my boss &amp; that he highly values me. The two biggest projects that I manage are both relatively niche areas which are not very common. Other projects are just getting started and I'm cautiously optimistic that I'll be able to have them done before my departure in about 9 weeks. </p>\n\n<p>I would hope to be able to return to this company should I return to the US in the future and be in need of work. For that reason I want to leave on a positive note. I'm also getting worried about letting something slip relating to my departure. I've known for 6+ months now that I will be leaving, but only last month did I buy the plane ticket that locks me into a date. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to give as much notice as is prudent out of respect for my manager &amp; how well he has treated me over the last 7+ years. However, I don't trust our HR department &amp; worry that by giving more notice than necessary I could jeopardize my desired timing for my last day. I feel like my manager would really appreciate having as much notice as possible to facilitate a smooth transition. </p>\n\n<p>There are also major transitions in my personal life that will become known at work through normal conversation that have already happened,or will soon happen, (moving out of my apartment, selling my car, etc) where I'm not a fan of \"lying\" to my manager &amp; coworkers to keep them in the dark. So far I've had to basically \"lie\" in answer to normal everyday conversations to not give away my plans. I am not comfortable doing that. </p>\n\n<p>I am happy to continue to help the company remotely after I move if needed to ensure a smooth transition for them. </p>\n\n<p>Questions: What would be a reasonable amount of notice to give? I'm thinking that 2 months is too much, although I'd like to give notice soon just so that I don't have to hide my plans anymore. Would 1 month be more appropriate?</p>\n\n<p>Based on other comments I've read I feel like while I can trust my manager to look out for me, I shouldn't trust HR. HR is my concern. I don't want to cost myself thousands of dollars in income by being pushed out early by HR. I know that HR has pushed employees out immediately when they've been leaving to go work for a competitor. I also know that other employees have given 2+ months notice about retirement. While I'm not retiring, I am leaving the country &amp; am not going to work for a competitor, so I feel my resignation is more similar to a retirement than a normal resignantion to pursue another job. </p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: I feel like if I were in my manager's position I would really want more notice of my plans to leave, but I'm concerned that HR might treat me poorly if I give more than 2 weeks notice. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

You first of all have to protect your own income.</p>\n\n<p>It is unlikely that they would hire your replacement and pay two of you to do the same job simultaneously, so giving a long notice may not work out for the team (and certainly doesn't if HR chooses to terminate immediately on notice). </p>\n\n<p>What might be better all around for the team is to make sure that you have done a good job of documenting what you do and having everything ready for a successor to take over on the day you give notice. Then with your resignation, hand over a document with the things your successor will need to know and a plan for knowledge transfer to someone currently on board so that the work will get covered until your replacement is hired. </p>\n\n<p>You say you manage projects, so it is incumbent on you to start to delegate more to your juniors. This can be done as part of your normal Project Management or as a specific effort to provide professional development to them.</p>\n\n<p>It might be a good thing if you can suggest to your boss that the company do more cross-training allowing you to start to train someone surreptitiously to take over for you without having to give notice or tell them that you are leaving.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those things you need to do to get ready to move, don't do until you are in your notice period.

I joined this company about two years ago so when I agreed to attend this training course, I didn't know much about this company. Now I know there's actually another department which is responsible for installing this software. This software is developed by this company and it is used in a particular field which means I'll never use it anywhere else if I leave this company, not to mention it is the installation of the software rather than how to use it. </p>\n\n<p>When I talk about this with my colleagues, everyone thinks this training is ridiculour for software engineers.

In addition (and the benefit of this depends on what your company does), your marketing department now has someone who thinks like a developer.

Sometimes he is approachable and we have calm, adult conversations.

I'm pretty sure this is the same thing he had a \"team discussion\" to us about it blocking a lot of work, but what do I know.</p></li>\n<li><p>Afterwards, he took me aside and started grilling me about method names and what they did in a codebase I worked on - replied something like \"I don't want to go by my fallible human memory, what does the code say\" - he looked about to launch like a firework and found myself cowering.</p></li>\n<li><p>This lead into a two hour session going over the code (which he had already signed off on and merged, as he does all pull requests) as he described what he had expected to see. It also turned out I had made a mistake in part of the code. I apologised and offered to fix my mistakes, but he seemed to want something more - for me to grovel? Not sure. I realised I was being apologetic and staring at my feet and just agreeing with everything he said - even if I didn't understand it - just to avoid him blowing up at me.</p></li>\n<li><p>After the day's work, realised I am 6'2\", 16 stone, and physically scared of him. And realised <strong>I was using the same conflict avoidance / appeasement techniques described to me by friends who've been in abusive relationships</strong> - including thinking \"I made a mistake, but maybe I've been treating him badly, maybe I should be nicer to him\", etc. You can imagine my reaction to this. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Due to staff turnover, he doesn't seem to have a line manager.

One group delivered the documentation and the other didn't. This was requested by me three weeks ago and, I was to focus on one area of the project but failed to do a follow up on this specific task, so when my manager asked, I have to take the blame for not doing a proper follow up. (This was on me, and I acknowledge that).</p>\n<p>Then we had our daily meeting, I requested the documentation again to John, reminded him that it was requested 3 weeks ago, and I needed for today. He told me that he agreed to give it to the technical team on Monday, he and the tech team had a private conversation about it, but I was never informed of this, thus I was not able to provide this information to my manager. I told John that I was fine that the team communicate internally and I encourage team work, but I need to be in the loop for any decision in order to be able to keep track and make sure everything is according to the plan (delivering this documentation on Monday could cause a delay), and I ask him to provide, if possible the documentation today. This is where things went out of control. He started to talk, in front of the team, things like &quot;Who do you think you are? I'm 20 years older than you, Why do you have this God-like attitude? If I said to Mark that I will send it on Monday, then he and you will have it on Monday. You are not a good PM, blah blah…&quot;. He keep going for like 5 minutes until the other functional architect told him to stop. Then we finished a very very bad, daily meeting. I told him at the end that we can talk in private or if he wanted, we can talk to my manager and get this issue resolved. I ended up with the feeling of a poorly managed meeting from my end.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> How to handle a conflictive team member who quickly escalates conversations on meetings and made side deals with other teams member without letting me, the PM, know?</p>\n<p><strong>How do I handle this team member?

Sure him having some notice and being able to prepare would help him out a bit since he could get a jump on the job hunt but that's not really worth potentially putting your own standing at the company at risk. If this was someone you were a close friend with irrespective of the workplace then I'd think differently about it but otherwise it's basically taking on a shedload of risk for yourself for no real gain. Remember that the firing-without-notice may be unethical but it's not <em>you</em> being unethical it is the company so it's not your responsibility to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>Being put into the position of having to covertly gather knowledge of his work and role isn't great and I know I'd feel uncomfortable too but it's what your employer is currently requiring of you and as potentially distasteful as it is it is not entirely uncommon. To be honest in your place I would look to pick up what bits and pieces of the knowledge you could within the bounds of your own comfort levels, for me this would be just paying attention to what he does and trying to get the knowledge more passively. You won't get anywhere near as much which will make taking on the departing Steve's duties harder for you but I know that would sit better with me. If your bosses are keen to push a more active situation of knowledge transfer then at point you can push back a bit and say something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm struggling to find a way to do that without it being obvious that something is going on. I know you don't want Steve to know but I think he'll know pretty quickly if I start explicitly shadowing him or asking about X/Y/Z. If you want me to do those things I think you'll need to have a talk with him first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At that point they will need to decide what is more important to them - keeping it secret or extracting the most knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>If they ask you to do them and lie about the reasons why then you can re-iterate that you aren't comfortable with doing that and that you feel it will be transparent and that if/when he works out he is going to be fired and they were hiding from them that they won't get <em>anything</em> out him and may even face him being actively resistant. That way you aren't saying \"nah, don't want to\" you're saying \"this won't get you what you want\" which is a subtle but important distinction that shows you are still on \"Team Employer\". To be honest if they can't see that then you probably want to start polishing the old CV since they probably aren't people you want to be working for and they may even do the same to you at some point so keeping your options prepared would be a wise move!</p>\n"
