I know that if I wanted to apply for a regular position (for instance, as a software developer), only my classic CV is enough (and the long one might actually be counter-productive). However, the kind of position I'm interested in is very similar to a public research position, i.e. people there publish, applying for public funding, might even co-supervise PhD students. </p>\n\n<p>So, what kind of CV should I send for such a position? Should I consider the application process as the standard public one, or rather as the standard industry one? </p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>In case it's relevant, it's in Computer Science, and I'm thinking of positions such as those available at Microsoft Research, IBM Research, etc. </p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>As a general rule of thumb, if the position you are applying for (1) has the term \"researcher\" or something similar in the position title and (2) requires a PhD (or research masters), definitely send the academic one. The fact they're looking for PhDs means they're interested in research experience, and your academic CV will highlight that much better than your industry one.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, it is an industry position, so I would do my best to keep the resume two pages, and offer to send the full CV on request. Definitely include \"Selected Publications\" and \"Selected Oral Presentations\" sections, but keep it short.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One extra idea for consideration: I sent my (academic) resume to an industry position, and they sent it back asking for a short (one to three) sentence blurb describing each of my projects (at the time, my resume included work as a research assistant, graduate student, and post-doc). I ended up using that format for all the jobs I applied to, since most people have no idea what \"Temporal Dynamics of the Cortico-limbic System\" actually means. It's a good way to help them actually get a feel for what you accomplished and what your skills are.</p>\n"

The paper was based on my work and well received by PhD committee of my Institute. The paper was submitted 3 years back. The paper was in status \"Editor Assigned\" for 6 months. After that its status changed to \"Under Review\". After 9 months in this status (15 months after submission date), I sent a polite mail to editor asking about how much time it will take to complete review? There was no response. After I month similar gentle mail was sent. There was no response. After month, I again sent query (18 months after submission). At that Editor replied saying that they could not review the paper as assigned reviewers either refuse to review or did not agree to review. The paper was rejected after 18 months without any review comment.</p>\n\n<p>So how does one know where it requires improvement? If paper was not of required quality why they kept with them for so long?  </p>\n\n<p>I feel that it is wrongly rejected.  </p>\n\n<p>Is it correct answer?  </p>\n\n<p>How can it show status as Under Review and then Editor says no Reviewer did not accept or refuse. My understanding is that paper goes in \"Under Review\" state only after \"Reviewer\" accepts to review. So what would have happened? Why Editor requires 3 months just to tell the status and comes back with mail like this? Editor did not bother reply to mail. Is it that he got angry because of persistent queries. </p>\n\n<p>I had even worst experience with next Journal. The paper was submitted and it remained in status \"With Editor\" for 9 months. Wiser by experience, I asked Editor about status? After persisting with it for about 2 more months, Chief Editor said that they rejected paper based on quick review as paper is not suitable to Journal as it does not meet its criteria like Originality, Depth etc. Again there no review comments about improvement.</p>\n\n<p>It is not sour grape, I do feel that around 60% papers in that Journal do not possess these qualities and have been published in 6-8 months (after revision).\nIf paper is not of required standard, they could have rejected in 2-3 months, why it took them such long time. If I would not have sent mail, probably it would have remained with them for long time. This work is now 3 years old not published anywhere and I even do not know what to do to improve. I am feeling very bad and really do not know what to do?</p>\n\n<p>What would happened? Is it wrong to ask editors about status even after 9 months or year?

        "golden_answer": " <p>The delays you mention are really excessive (note: I feel that way even though I am a mathematician), and your anger is quite deserved for that.</p>\n\n<p>From what I heard from editors I know, it can happen that a paper is sent to successive referees who decline to referee, or worse accept and then don't do the job and do not respond to queries. At some point, the editor have to either do a referee's job themselves, which usually do not happen, or reject the paper. Usually, this happen with papers that are not clearly wrong or uninteresting, but that are difficult to read and do not <em>really</em> interest the tentative referees. In some case, you can have better result by submitting to a different, e.g. more specialized journal.</p>\n\n<p>In your case, what bothers me is that being in a PhD, you have an advisor. What does she think of the paper? If there is no obvious problem in it, did you submit to journal suggested by her? On what ground? Is it possible that your institute, whose PhD committee you says received your work well, has much lower standards than international journals?</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the only effective answer to your question is: seek feedback from a knowledgeable individual. It could be your advisor, but if needed it could also be another senior researcher in your field and institute, or even someone working elsewhere in your field. The closer the better, as it increase the probability of getting the feedback and the probability that it will be honest.</p>\n\n<p>Last, as already mentioned, open access journal can be as toughly selective as subscription journals, and should not be considered easy shots when everything else has failed. I would not recommend submitting to a shady journal, let alone an OA one since shady OA journal often charge several hundred of dollars for publication.</p>\n"

It's gone all right, I guess--I wrote some code for my lab, got As in classes (although grades are utterly beside the point). But I'm not sure it's working out, or that I can <em>make</em> it work out. I'm not sure I have what it takes.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, I can hold my own in technical conversations with senior coworkers--even (tactfully) point out flaws in their methods, suggest new approaches, pitch new experiments, and things like that. I've often heard \"yeah, good idea!\", only for nothing to ever come of it. What's that about? Are they being merely polite? Or am I supposed to be more \"enterprising,\" somehow (whatever that means)? Is it my personality? I'm sometimes told that I need to be more aggressive or self-assured or something like that, but I don't really know what that means (other than \"act like more of a jerk\"), and don't feel comfortable trying to artificially change my personality in that way. What's wrong with saying \"sorry?\"</p>\n\n<p>It seems like I'm missing something fundamental, maybe socially. It's been extraordinarily hard for me to get into the flow and be part of the team. Some other students walk into a room where people are discussing a project, make some goofy offhand comment, and get a coauthorship. On the other hand, I'm somehow having a hard time even figuring out who I report to, or if I <em>have</em> a me-project, or how to answer my questions about things like reporting and project ownership. There is something going on that I'm deaf to. I don't get it. Students at $PRESTIGIOUS_INSTITUTION aren't supposed to have this problem.</p>\n\n<p>I also haven't really made any friends here. I'm on the shy side, but this isn't like me. I never knew I was so socially inept. If I'd been able to make friends, I wouldn't be bothering you kind people. </p>\n\n<p>On top of it all, I'm no longer very sure that I believe in my subfield.

Like I'll never, ever, ever be able to get a thesis together. Is all this the \"bad fit\" that people talk about when it comes to picking a lab? Am I just incompetent? Do I like reading about science more than I like doing it? Who do I even talk to about this? What do I say, and how do I get answers? Am I just completely trounced? Why don't I go take a job in industry and >quadruple my salary?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it's as simple as \"you're fine; this is normal. Get some sleep and go join a club to find friends.

If you don't have a well-defined goal, it's natural that you would feel like you're floundering. Advisors are busy; if you don't tell them you need guidance, they will assume everything is working out (until they realize that it isn't, at which point they'll blame you). So, I would recommend asking for a meeting with your advisor (or whoever is in charge of your lab) and try to better define your research goals.</p>\n\n<p>I think everything else you describe comes from this. Once you have a good project and are getting interesting results, you will feel more like a part of the lab and some of the other angst will disappear. Your lab might never be a perfect match for you, but I suspect it will suffice in terms of giving you a PhD and a chance to figure out what's important to you when you choose your next position.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maybe it's as simple as \"you're fine; this is normal.

For instance, in the ACM Digital Library (see example entry <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1361191&amp;CFID=598984303&amp;CFTOKEN=52947095\">here</a>), you can click on the right-hand side on Export -> Bibtex and obtain a bibtex entry. Other typesetting systems, such as Microsoft Word, usually have similar plugins or features.</p>\n\n<p>Now, why would your English teacher (or publishers) even care about whether you write Thomasz Antonie or T. Antonie (or Antonie, T., ...)? At the end of the day, this is not so much about understandability of the reference, but more about giving the paper a more professional look-and-feel. For journals it is important to retain their \"trademark\" optics. This includes obvious aspects, such as font size, column layout, or margins, but also extends to using a consistent reference style within each paper, and also across papers published in the same journal. </p>\n"

Oral exams with only 1 student + 1 examiner and no paper trail typically end up contributing low percentages to the final grade for the semester and even lower percentages to your Bachelor/Master grades. The next more important ones already had a 2nd observer (usually PhD student or postdoc) though still without protocol.<br />\nEverything of higher importance (including legally relevant exams) is done with someone writing a protocol, and in some cases even audio records are taken. This is done exactly in case there is dispute about the grading.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rather than complaining about the grade in order to get a better grade, I've only met students who asked to have their grade lowered to &quot;failed&quot; so they could re-take the exam.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For the &quot;low importance&quot; oral exams I've been involved with, a complaint would usually have resulted in the offer to have another exam which for sure would have someone writing a protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Back when I was studying, for the low-importance exams in many cases it would have been possible to retake them the next semester/year (sometimes even the high-importance ones, under certain conditions). However, I've never met anyone who did care sufficiently to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As always, the exam regulations of your department are what matters. You need to look them up and/or ask at the exam office.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Grades are submitted to the exam office, and the professor thus cannot easily change the grade. Thus, the risk of getting your grade lowered if you complain to the professor is small. But so is your chance to get it raised: both will likely need a (very) formal procedure with you, the professor and the exam office.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A professor &quot;can give any grades they want[ed]&quot; only in the sense any public servant in government administration can do anything they want to an application/procedure you filed there: professors in Germany are public servants  and exams are one of their public servant duties. Violations of these duties are considered quite serious in general (they took an oath to fulfil these duties).<br />\n(Which does not mean that unfair grading does not happen - but it does mean that if you file a complaint about unfair treatment in an exam, that is a serious accusation)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>One thing you may consider for future exams: as students, we were allowed to &quot;bring a friend&quot;, who would then automatically be a potential witness. If there's a problem with the professor's grading, such a potential witness may make the whole procedure more fair already by just being there.<br />\nThis happened very rarely, but I remember a professor recommending this for an entirely different reason: so that the friend can find out what kind of exam to expect. I.e., they recommended that we look for someone who'd be comfortable taking us along before doing the exam ourselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>A last thing is to bear in mind that the perceived difficulty of question and your difficulty of answers may not predict well even a rather objectively justified grade. There are (legitimate) differences in the style how different professors approach the task of examining. Some will ask everyone questions on a similar level of difficulty and then consider the answers, others adjust the difficulty of the question according to preliminary grades and previous answers (I found it extremely hard to judge as a student how such an exam went - but I do know since how a lemon must feel after sqeezing.

I know that the <a href=\"http://aimath.org/\">American Institute of Mathematics</a> does this, and it can make the difference if the only other option would put the nanny somewhere far from the conference. </p>\n\n<p>Depending on the size of your conference, this needn't necessarily mean that you subsidize or even organize the childcare; it can help even just to put attendees in touch with local daycares/nannies/babysitters, or provide other information. However unless your conference is very small, I hope you'll give thought to implementing some of the other steps that Lalin outlines.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Added February 2015:</p>\n\n<p>Greg Martin has written an excellent paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06326\">\"Addressing the underrepresentation of women in mathematics conferences\"</a> that addresses exactly this question, which is simultaneously scholarly and actionable.

My own experience, and that of my peers, is that a typical college class has a cohort of good students who will mainly earn grades of A or B, some number of poor students who will earn unsatisfactory grades, and a few \"in the middle\" students.  That gives a bimodal distribution, with the valley just about where the peak is in that bell curve.</p>\n\n<p>I urge you to look at past classes and check the grade distributions when you have used absolute grading.

(<em>Um,</em> and to department chairs, if it comes to that.)  You haven't mentioned your field, nor whether your students are undergraduates, but if your examinations can have a reasonable number of questions, measure the performance on <em>every question</em> and then exclude from the computed grade any where performance of the class as a whole is below some cutoff you establish heuristically.  Almost everyone's grade will go up, and you can easily explain that you excluded those questions or problems that were \"too hard.\"  (In the rare case where a student gets only the \"hard\" problems right, you can make an independent adjustment; that never happened to me.)  I do this with a spreadsheet that has student names in the left column, then one column for each question.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've evaluated an assessment, you must look at the questions you excluded as \"too hard\" and If the difficulty was with the question, fix it.

To ensure fairness as well as fulfill the minimum average grade required by the instructor, I often have to re-grade their papers <em>multiple times</em>. For example, when first grading Josh's work, I gave him 4/5 pts for question 1. After finding out some others did better than him (but still not entirely correct), I gave the other students 4/5 and take one more point from Josh, and this process keeps going on and on. As a result, when I return the assignments to the class, their papers are full of my corrections for their previously assigned points.</p>\n\n<p>I did mention curving to the instructor, but he didn't seem to be OK with that. In fact, he manually re-graded the first HW instead of curving it, which made me feel bad (and insulted).\nIt doesn't seem like the students have an issue with the way I grade, but I still wonder whether modifying the grades multiple times make me look unprepared/unprofessional?*</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",

If there is any concern about the difficulty of an assignment, this should be handled by adjusting the final grades, rather than the assignment-by-assignment grades. This can be handled by stating at the beginning of the semester something as simple as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The instructor reserves the right to adjust the grading points downward on a uniformly sliding scale.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This allows the instructor to adjust for any roadbumps in the difficulty of assignments without having to making too many adjustments in the grades of individual assignments. This also gives students a truer sense of their performance than having grades arbitrarily raised to ensure an artificial minimum average. Also, because grades are uniformly adjusted (e.g., if an A was 90/100 and B was 80/100, and an A becomes 84/100, then B becomes 74/100), there's no room to complain about arbitrary curving of grades, except for the single selection of the D/F or A/B transition that would drive the process).</p>\n\n<p>If there is no option but to change the grading rubric, I would instead use the following approach. If you know what the general flow of the problem is, take a random cross-sample of the students' papers—say 8 or 10—and compare their results with the standards. If you feel comfortable with the agreement between your standard and the homeworks you use, go ahead and grade the rest. If not, then make adjustments, <em>add a few more papers</em>, and repeat until you're satisfied. But regarding dozens of papers every time seems like a waste of everybody's time. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid looking unprofessional doing so, I'd mark lightly in pencil until you decide the final grading scheme. Once it's locked in, you can switch over to whatever you use and it will look \"final,\" saving you from any potential embarrassment. But really, it's understood that people make mistakes and changes when grading, so I wouldn't worry too much about it overall.</p>\n"

For example, cut-offs for English language exams such as TOEFL are always mark-based, but most exam takers will be happy to practice using old exams.

Thus, it is unethical and against policy for me to sell those books once I'm done with the corresponding courses. Specifically, the policy is that <strong>I cannot \"make a profit on\" them</strong>, but other than that I am free to do with them as I please. I find that having the physical book is helpful when I'm taking the course, but afterwards if I need to reference it a digital copy will suffice. And while having my office/residence full of these high-level materials certainly makes me feel good about myself, it's not practical. Thus, <strong>what can I do with these textbooks that will have the biggest, most positive impact on academia?</strong></p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>As an academic librarian, I am frequently asked similar questions. First, <em>please</em> <strong>don't just drop them off at the library</strong>. Unwanted donations are a significant problem at libraries—it's very difficult to recycle books, so libraries end up having to <em>pay</em> to get rid of books we don't need, on top of the time and effort it takes to deal with a big pile of books on our doorstep.</p>\n\n<p>Do feel free to contact a librarian to see if they would be interested, but be prepared for the answer to be no: textbooks, which change edition quickly and tend to be most useful only to people taking specific classes, are fairly low on the list for most libraries. Some large university libraries do have policies of obtaining a copy of every required textbook, but they will already have a mechanism for purchasing those in a timely manner. If you do go this route, please also be as tentative as possible in your offer: Librarians also tend to dislike telling people \"no\", so if you push, the librarian is likely to take your books and then quietly dumpster them.</p>\n\n<p>There are some charities that take donations of (some) books. Our library uses <a href=\"https://www.betterworldbooks.com/Info-Donate-Books-m-7.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Better World Books</a>, which I believe is currently accepting recent textbooks, and you could also look around for programs close to your home.</p>\n\n<p>The most straightforward option might be to pass the books on to another student or students in your program. If you want your donation to have an impact beyond just the student who receives them you could ask them to \"pay it forward\" by passing along some other books at some future date. (You could also just ask that they pass <em>your</em> books along gratis, but the value of this gift will decrease with every iteration as the books get older and new editions come out.)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't care about keeping any value within academia, you could offer the books for pick-up through something like Craig's List. Whether people want your books for study or a book art program or as kindling for their wood-burning stove, the books will at least have value beyond gathering dust in a box in your closet.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to recycle some or all of your books, you will need to deconstruct them first, or locate a service that specializes in books (these are very hard to find, and may have a charge). If you want to do it yourself, a box cutter or utility knife to cut the pages out works pretty well. The pages can go to any paper recycling service. The cover itself may also be recyclable, but any glue and/or stitching will probably need to go into the trash. You probably shouldn't compost the books, as page coatings and inks can be toxic.</p>\n"

At least in the United States, assistant professors generally do not have \"tenure\", and they will be evaluated at the end of the tenure period (typically 6 years). If they do not pass this evaluation, their position is terminated and they lose their job. That happens all the time -- most departments at R1 universities will have a case in the last 20 years where this happened.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have tenure, things become more complicated. There is the concept of a \"post-tenure review\" at most universities, which is triggered when a tenured professor is not productive for several years (as well as for other reasons, such as misconduct). It does happen that people lose their jobs if they do not pass such reviews, though admittedly this method is rarely applied: In most cases, the person in question just gets poor job evaluations, doesn't get a pay raise, is not further promoted, and gets assigned higher teaching and/or administrative duties than everyone else.</p>\n"

I kept in contact with my letters of recommenders (their letters are strong), and published in an undergraduate mathematics journal. I want to transition from mathematics to computer science for a PhD program. I delayed my entrance into a PhD program to work in industry. Now I am in a position where I can enter back into school. </p>\n\n<p>The problem I face is that 1) I lack many of the preliminary courses required by many PhD programs in Computer Science and 2) My GPA is on the low side due to extenuating circumstances during those respective semesters (which relates to my reasons of delaying a PhD to pursue industry work). </p>\n\n<p>The PhD programs I am interested in are very competitive. I contacted a professor at one of these universities (nationally ranked &amp; well-known) and he said he'd vouch for me whenever I applied and a few of my recommenders know him personally. But according to the school's website individual faculty have little input in admission decisions (as admissions is determined by a group of faculty) and they seem to have a strict set of coursework requirements needed in order to be admitted into their program. Also, my GPA falls outside the range of the \"average\" admitted students.</p>\n\n<p>So, even though I have strong LoRs, strong research experience and a professor interested in me, I have a low GPA and not nearly enough of the core courses to satisfy their coursework requirements. </p>\n\n<p>I applied/was accepted to do a post-bac at a well-regarded school. I will be a credit (but non-degree seeking) undergraduate student and can take any range of courses I want (both undergrad + grad).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: </p>\n\n<p>1) Will pursuing a post-bac route help me get into a CS PhD program? My aim here is to complete the core set of requirements, bolster my GPA, and make myself competitive for PhD programs in CS (I don't want to do an MS program). Since I lack basic CS coursework I'll be taking courses in programming, data structures, analysis of algorithms, computer organizations and the like.</p>\n\n<p>2) When will be the best time to apply for PhD programs? I plan to take courses on a part-time basis (since I am working full-time), so a max of 1-2 courses a semester. I was thinking if I applied next Fall then I'd only have two programming courses completed (required sequence), and a data structure course in progress. I still wouldn't have completed analysis of algorithms, etc. courses by that time.

At Michigan, when we reported a case, the evidence was compelling. There was always lots of copying and there were often damning artifacts like the same odd misspellings in the comments.

In my opinion, if you explicitly have notifications enabled you can't at the same time be annoyed that you get notified. </p>\n\n<p>Second, you'll need to understand an almost universal basic truth - starting from a certain seniority, most people in academia get <strong>a lot</strong> of email.

You are misinterpreting what the purpose of class essays is - this isn't supposed to be a witty, innovative text that entertains the lecturer, and the lecturer will likely not mind so much reading about the same debugging techniques over and over again. The purpose of this text is to explain what <strong>you</strong> know about said debugging techniques. A secondary purpose is that you show that you know how to write an academic text. Some semi-witty text is likely to fail the second test, and spending a lot of paper space on an unrelated joke is likely to at least be a bad indicator for the first test (that is, if I get a paper where the author spends a lot of time writing about semi-related nonsense, my initial impression is that the author didn't really know what to write about the actual topic).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason why I think I can get away with this is because the teacher frequently cracks jokes during his lecture</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's a place and a time to be humorous.

My supervisor got sick a couple of weeks before the deadline and therefore our final meeting was postponed until only a week before the deadline. In this meeting she told me that my thesis was too complex and it would be difficult to efficiently use SPSS. She adviced to change a lot of stuff and I eventually had to rewrite big parts of my thesis. Due to the limited time until the deadline I had left, I used an old student's thesis for inspiration (as we partially had the same research question and often made the same references). I had no intention of copying or being inspired this much by this thesis. As I said, my own research questions reflected his a lot and I read the thesis many times through. Naturally then, it took up a large portion of my working memory during these days and I appearantly was disproportionally influenced to the point my thesis started to reflect the paper too much.</p>\n<p>I now need to send an e-mail back to the exam commission with an explanation with what happened. What scares me the most is that should the exam commission decide that I plagiarized my thesis, I am not allowed to resit the thesis for one whole semester (6 months) after the students who failed the resit re-do their theses. This would mean that I would be restricted for the thesis for  1.5 years. This would be such a shame, as I finished everything else, and already was planning to start my Master in a couple of months.

I now see that my thesis indeed reflects the paper disproportionally. I am out of ideas on what to do.

It's important to have this conversation, even aside from the particular question you are asking here. (You don't want to risk discovering much later that you and your advisor had different visions for what the thesis should be like.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a good answer to so many questions on this site (I have started to think that there should be an \"Ask your advisor!\" closure option), but it seems especially true here.  From the OP's comment I can see that the master's thesis is being done in <strong>mathematics</strong>.  The expectations and requirements for a master's thesis in mathematics are so highly variable across institutions and countries that I can think of almost nothing (other than \"Ask your advisor!\") which would be guaranteed to be universally applicable.</p>\n\n<p>In mathematics programs in the US, it is especially unclear what work constitutes a master's thesis, especially in pure mathematics.  Unlike the situation in many other countries, there are relatively few full-time master's students in American universities, even compared to the number of master's degrees awarded: in my experience, more master's degrees go to talented, ambitious undergraduates who get them alongside their bachelor's degrees, or to PhD students who have decided to drop out of the program and get a consolation degree.  In my case I got a master's degree along with my bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago, and for such a top university you might be surprised to hear how minimal the requirements were: I had to complete all nine trimester courses that first year graduate (i.e., PhD) students take (I did so over two years) and pass a <em>pro forma</em> foreign language exam.  [In particular <strong>I did not write a master's thesis</strong>.]  When I went on to my PhD studies (at Harvard) I found that I was about as well prepared as most of the other students.  I don't recall that my having a master's degree came up once during my five years in a PhD program...with the possible exception that some students would, a year or two into their program, fill out paperwork and pay a small fee to get a master's degree, whereas I already had one of those so chose to keep my money.</p>\n\n<p>Having been heavily involved with the graduate (mostly PhD) program at the University of Georgia in recent years, I can say that here a master's thesis is whatever the advisor and student agree that it is, subject to the approval of two other committee members.  Writing a thesis is one route; there is another route involving more coursework and some exams.  Among master's thesis advisors I've talked to, the sense is that the student should take the thesis as an opportunity to engage with some piece of mathematics at a deeper level than they have done before, to the extent that they have <em>mastered</em> it and can show this mastery with an original (or at least, independent) exposition.  This description seems rather at odds with the one given in another answer to this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NO. Undergrads may get away with using one (or a few) papers to synthesize the essence into their own viewpoint, but at the post-grad level you should be reading for width and depth, which means using every seminal work in your field as well as exploring the newer papers on the topic. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is probably a correct description of some academic fields, but not for mathematics.  Very few mathematics undergraduates are reading \"real\" math papers at all.  The task of reading, understanding and writing about even <em>one</em> \"real\" math paper may in fact be sufficient for a master's thesis.  There are even certain papers out there for which rewriting them so as to contain the level of detail and completeness that would satisfy a master's thesis committee would be a real service to the mathematical community.  I think that most PhD students in mathematics do not <em>use every seminal work in [their] field</em>: I didn't, for instance.  </p>\n\n<p>I am not saying that just any old thing will suffice for a master's thesis in mathematics: I am saying that the <em>global</em> requirements are very few, so it becomes more important to talk to your advisor.  </p>\n\n<p>I have so far supervised one master's thesis.  My student carefully read and wrote about two papers concerning geometry of numbers and Legendre's Equation ax^2+by^2+cz^2 = 0.  She then tried to extend the techniques of the second paper to diagonal quadratic equations in n \\geq 4 variables.  Much of this was easy, but the key was the existence of a \"magic sublattice\" defined in the three-dimensional case by the necessary congruence conditions for Legendre's Equation to have a solution.  After much trouble (and some help from me), she was eventually able to prove that for more than three variables such a magic sublattice did not exist.  She wrote up a thesis which contained expositions of the two papers she read plus a proof of this result (plus a few more small things, totalling a few pages).  I remember that she was concerned that her thesis was rather short: 45 pages double-spaced.  I thought her thesis was an unusually strong one and told her so.  (If people are wondering, I think her result is not yet publishable -- it's along the lines of showing that a certain proof strategy cannot work, and such things are hard to publish in mathematics -- but that the work could be continued and made publishable.  I honestly think that makes it an above average American master's thesis in mathematics.)</p>\n"

        "golden_answer": " <p>I'll try to summarize some of the issues.</p>\n<p>First, there is the concept of the stapled thesis that is common in some fields/places. The thesis consists of a set of published papers (<em>published</em>) and, perhaps some unifying commentary. The thesis itself is (largely) just a collection.</p>\n<p>Publishers usually require that you give them copyright to things of yours that they publish, and will give you back a license for some (but not all) uses. That license, these days, will almost always give you rights to include the work in a &quot;stapled&quot; thesis (I don't know of exceptions, actually, but must admit the possibility). Generally, though, a stapled thesis probably isn't considered by the publisher to be a &quot;republication&quot; of the already published work.</p>\n<p>Somewhat orthogonal to that is the notion of self plagiarism. This is a form that has only some of the characteristics of (ordinary) plagiarism, though without misattribution of the person who originated the ideas. Self plagiarism is considered a violation because if you, for example, copy-paste your own earlier work without citation, you break the chain of evidence for discoveries. The early work contains context that a researcher wants to see along with the current work. You avoid self plagiarism by quoting and citing the early work, permitting that chain of context to be followed.</p>\n<p>A third issue you raise opens the problem that if you put unpublished work in a thesis (your unpublished manuscripts) and <em>if that is considered publishing</em> then some publishers won't accept it. That is becoming somewhat less of a problem these days with preprint servers (and is not much of a problem at all in some fields that welcome preprints), but you need to be sensitive to that. But, if you have unpublished work, you can do what you like with it, copy-paste, whatever. It just might limit what you can do afterwards.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking it is better (and a better habit) to keep things clean. If you copy, do so judiciously and with citation. Make sure that your license (from published work) permits what you want to do. Ask if you aren't sure. If you cite, you avoid hints of plagiarism.</p>\n<p>If you want to write a non-stapled type of thesis using early work the best path is to treat the work as you would the work of anyone else. Quote from it, but not too extensively, just as you would from the work of others, and cite what you use. Then, if the thesis contains new results and extensions to old results, it might just be publishable as a new work. I'll also note that the license from a publisher will probably give you rights to copy somewhat more extensively than you could from other works, but likely not unlimited copying.</p>\n<p>A major issue for you, however, is what your university expects in a thesis. If they accept a stapled thesis, you are fine. Write up the &quot;bridge/summary&quot; commentary if needed and staple it together. If they accept a new summary of old work, you are probably fine, but keep it clean - quote and cite. But if they expect an entirely new work (unlikely under the circumstances) then you need to provide that.</p>\n<p>It would, however, seem odd to me if the university permitted unlimited copy-paste without quote or citation. That is just poor scholarship.</p>\n<p>I hope this is enough commentary to guide you.</p>\n"

Otherwise, your application may seem out of place.</p>\n<p>The categorization of research depends a lot on your perspective. &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clinical</a>&quot; research, though refers to work done in human subjects for medical purposes, such as trials of drugs or devices; for a clinician/physician, the antonym would be usually be &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">basic research</a>&quot; referring to studying of the underlying processes or mechanisms; basic research can include both theoretical/computational approaches and wet biology/bench science. Clinical research can also involve primarily computational/statistical approaches, though, especially in fields such as epidemiology and public health.</p>\n<p>Because these lines are not drawn neatly, I'd advise against using the terms without feeling comfortable with them. Instead, say what you really mean, plainly and specifically.</p>\n"

The <em>vast</em> majority are not restricted in this way. You can see this for yourself by looking at the author lists of papers published in conferences like <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2016/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S&amp;P</a>. Specifically look at those papers coming from US institutions and note the many papers with at least one author who is an international student.</p>\n\n<p>US graduate programs in cybersecurity routinely admit large numbers of international students, who for the most part have access to the same research opportunities as students that are US citizens. If you want to be sure that the program you are applying to conducts research in which non-citizens may participate, check the authors of publications coming out of that lab - look up the authors online, and see if there are many international students among them. Some labs might also have a web page where they list current graduate students involved in their research.</p>\n\n<p>(You obviously can't determine citizenship of an author accurately with a Google search, but if there are a large number of international students involved, it's almost certain that there are also non-citizens involved.)</p>\n\n<p>One difference is that you will not be eligible for certain federal fellowships specifically for US citizen students involved in cybersecurity research, such as the <a href=\"https://www.sfs.opm.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scholarship for Service</a> program.</p>\n"

Lacking true inspiration, let me just comment on your criteria.</p>\n<p>(Let me also assume that we are talking about jobs at a &quot;research university&quot;, as it seems you are.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Research experience (research articles, research talks, expository articles, perhaps books).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mathematicians are judged on a combination of research <em>promise</em> and research <em>success</em>: as you get older, one looks increasingly for evidence that the former has been converted into the latter.  However, for every kind of research job in mathematics, they are hiring you on the basis of the work they expect you to do in the future.  So, for instance, if you have already solved a major problem, you can coast on that for a time but after a while people want to hear what you are working on now.  Research talks are probably the best way of exploring the dichotomy between past and future research: as such, they are very important whenever they exist, which is almost always on the tenure track job market and in a small (but perhaps increasing?) minority of postdoctoral jobs.</p>\n<p>Expository articles generally do not count towards the research component of your application.  (If someone is counting papers, then if you have 8 research papers and 1 expository paper then people will probably say you have 9 papers altogether, so it counts a little bit.  But <em>if pressed</em>, its value could contract considerably: e.g. if there are worries that a candidate has too few papers, than a paper viewed as expository will probably not allay this worry.) Strategically it is probably best to advertise expository articles as having some teaching / mentoring / service component, if at all possible.</p>\n<p>With regard to writing books: one of my most distinguished colleagues, Dino Lorenzini, wrote <a href=\"http://alpha.math.uga.edu/%7Elorenz/book.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an excellent and rather successful book</a> near the beginning of his career.  He now tells anyone who will listen that junior faculty should not write books.  Of course sometimes the heart wants what it wants, but from a strategic perspective I think this is eminently sound, and I say this as someone who may turn around and write some books now that I am solidly into my mid-career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Teaching experience (tutoring, undergraduate courses, graduate courses, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Successful teaching experiences</em> are indeed valued for a research job.  At most research universities teaching is still a main component of one's job and, especially, of one's promotion and tenure packages.  Most research departments are looking most of the time for <em>thoroughly solid</em> teachers rather than especially brilliant or innovative ones.  Your teaching dossier should convey most of all that the department who hires you will never have to think about your teaching in a negative way.</p>\n<p>Some graduate students do not get to do instruction at all (as opposed to TA work: grading, leading problem sessions, and so forth).  There is a big difference between TA work and instruction, and as a hirer I am very wary of candidates who attempt to convince me that they will be a successful instructor based only on TA experience.  I would strongly advise every math graduate student to be the instructor of record for at least one successful undergraduate course (where &quot;successful&quot; means you can get a strong teaching letter out of the experience).</p>\n<p>Teaching experience at the graduate level is almost unheard of for graduate students and is far from guaranteed in postdocs.  Even within my own department, some of my colleagues feel strongly that postdocs should teach topics graduate courses in their areas of interest, whereas other colleagues feel that it is the job of the tenure track faculty to teach these courses.  I lean more towards the latter, and I don't feel that teaching graduate courses is an important part of a tenure track job application: I would be equally impressed or more with other kinds of interactions with the graduate program, e.g. participating in or organizing seminars, reading theses, and so forth.</p>\n<p>I'm having a hard time thinking about how tutoring experience could play a significant role.  If you have founded the Khan Academy or the <a href=\"http://euclidlab.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Euclid Lab</a>, you would probably get some attention / consideration for this.  Much less and your employers are unlikely to care.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Academic background (grades, the university of graduation, current affiliation, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No research university that I know of asks for grades or transcripts for candidates for faculty positions.  Of course your <em>pedigree</em> -- i.e., where you did your undergraduate and graduate work, and your current institution -- is of some importance, but not <em>that</em> much importance.  Anyway, what's done is done here: presumably you took what opportunities you could to attend / work at better, rather than worse, institutions!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reference (who is writing reference letter and how he is writing it).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or she!  When you are applying for your first postdoc, your adviser's letter may well be the <em>most</em> important part of the application: most graduates, even very strong ones, cannot speak about their research accomplishments and near future goals as convincingly as their advisers can.  Later on your adviser's letter gets less important, but you probably get more letters overall, and they are always a key part of the application.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personal (natural) features (nationality, race, language, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the United States it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race.  Nationality is probably a no-go as well.  Language issues are important: if English is not your native language, employers will (or at any rate, should) look carefully at your skills.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social and family status (connections, marriage, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Professional connections can be important; e.g. they come out in recommendation letters and in your academic pedigree.  It is illegal for employers to inquire about your marital status, sexual orientation, or whether you have children.  It is not illegal for you to bring these things up, and if you have a &quot;two-body problem&quot; -- i.e., a partner who is also an academic -- than you should do so at some point, and that brings an extra layer of complication to the process.  But if a candidate is not looking for an academic job for her partner, I honestly don't care at all whether she is married, gay, celibate, and so forth.  I can assure you that in most American departments any such talk about these matters in the context of a hiring discussion would be rapidly quelled.</p>\n"

It also means that the possibility of changing to a University (again in Spain) decrease the longer you stay there, virtually becoming zero after some five years</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Spanish academia requires that you go through a system of pre-qualification (<em>acreditación</em>) for any of the four current faculty positions. Other countries such as France (<em>Qualification</em>) and Italy also have a similar system but I believe that the particularity of the Spanish case is that you need to fulfil a lot of different requirements in teaching, research, knowledge transfer, etc. You can check the requirements in this <a href=\"http://www.aneca.es/Programas-de-evaluacion/Evaluacion-de-profesorado/ACADEMIA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> (sorry, no English version). Being able to fulfil these requirements is relatively straight-forward for the first faculty position (<em>profesor ayudante doctor</em>) but it becomes increasingly difficult for the next ones <strong>if you are not employed at a University</strong>.

Maybe I could see a case where departmental overhead is sufficient to start a lab but I would still think of this as \"startup money\" even if established professors have access to the same pool.</p>\n\n<p>However, asking funding agencies to pay your salary would be the usual course of business and the expectation by the funding agencies is that they would cover the portion of your salary corresponding to your effort towards the project: if the project is going to be about half of your work, it would pay at least half your salary.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a gap in extramural funding, the expectation is that the institution would pick up your salary in the meantime, though this may come with other institutional responsibilities attached like an increased teaching load or some administrative work, especially if you have more than a brief interval without outside funding. I would be greatly worried if the institution isn't willing to contribute in this circumstance, but it is reasonable for them to ask for you to look outside for funding.</p>\n\n<p>Funding for students in my field would also typically come from extramural grants: you would ask in a grant proposal that the work fund a graduate student to complete the experiments. Direct departmental support for students to do research is uncommon, but they may be supported by other external fellowships such as institutional training grants or grants directly to that student, or through a teaching or project assistantship through the department.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I could see the situation for startup funding being a little different as an internal candidate, that is, if the institution is expecting you to continue working in the lab space you are in (i.e., if you are a postdoc or scientist, taking over some space from your current PI) and grow your independence over time.</p>\n"

Even sometimes I felt being offended as she was criticizing my non-mathematical background and how my work does not feet to this field.\nAlso, even if she was reading my work, she was so careless in doing it especially to find the important facts in the work which led to the rejection as all the reviewers noticed that easily!! Worst than that, she never dares to discuss why my work was rejection and how to revise it, or how to answer the reviewers wisely!\nFor instance, I had a good chance at a top-tier conference but I failed the rebuttal phase while she just ignored my request to guide me through it.</p>\n\n<p>During the 4th year, it was clear to me that I have a total ignorance from her, like if I'm not a part of her group anymore.

I know I am not an MIT or Stanford student, but based on the external peer-feedbacks I received from other experts in my field, I do not see any reliable basis to be treated that way!

There are a lot of math PhD programs in the US, and most of the applicants to most of the programs (i.e., <em>not</em> Harvard/Princeton/Berkeley/Chicago/UCLA...) have applications which are \"uneven\" in some way.  Giving context and explanation for the weakest part of your application could be helpful for many students.</p></li>\n<li><p>I look at the personal statement first as a writing sample, second as a very broad measure of (mathematical) cultural awareness and sophistication and third as a chance to show that the applicant received a decent supply of rope and managed not to hang him/herself.

He said that he once got a personal statement that said that the student wanted to go to grad school in CS because he thought that any other career would involve a lot more work, and he was trying to take it easy.  This put the department head in a bit of a pickle.  As he proceeded to explain, this was exactly what he did not want to hear in a personal statement.  But how seriously does one take the personal statement?  Maybe the student was trying (and failing) to be funny.  Because the application was very strong in all other respects, the applicant was eventually admitted.  He failed out of the program less than a year later, because he was not willing to do any work.

Unfortunately, it appears likely that your supervisor is a predator and abuser given several red flags in your story.  In particular:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your supervisor waiting until you were impaired by alcohol before making unwanted sexual advances.  This is a massive red flag of abuse: safe and respectful people talk with prospective partners when they are sober.</li>\n<li>Your supervisor appears to have sought an isolated environment in the midst of a group event where he could assault you and where you could run away without others noticing. </li>\n<li>Your supervisor appears to be manipulating your interpretation of his sexual assault on you: you say things like \"we are OK with this\" (taking a collective view) and \"I know that he thought\" (taking his view) and \"he is sorry\" (how did you feel?) that indicate that your view of the situation is being strongly influenced by his view.  To be blunt: it doesn't matter what he thought or felt; what matters is what <em>you</em> thought and felt when you were sexually assaulted.  Making you feel responsible for his feelings is an abuse tactic.</li>\n<li>It sounds as though your supervisor engages in <a href=\"http://www.abuseandrelationships.org/Content/Behaviors/grooming.html\">grooming for abuse</a>, by picking certain \"favorite\" students and violating professional boundaries with them (talking about personal issues).  Some people just have minimal filter with everybody, but the picking favorites is a red flag: abusers often do this in order to identify people who will be good victims for their abuse, and then may wait quite patiently for an opportunity to switch into their preferred mode of abuse.</li>\n<li>Your supervisor chose to make a sexual advance on their student, over whose life they have a huge amount of power and control, rather than waiting until you were no longer their student and could be more of a peer as a partner.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, it's possible that your supervisor is not a predator and abuser, but that's a lot of red flags, including an actual sexual assault.  Furthermore, most abusers do not believe that they are abusers, and can often be very persuasive to others, including the victims that they ensnare. </p>\n\n<p>So, what would I recommend that you do?  Unfortunately, the student/advisor power dynamics make this a tricky situation to navigate without doing harm to yourself and your career.  I would thus recommend that you start by protecting yourself and then find resources or otherwise get professional support to help decide how to proceed.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Never drink or otherwise impair yourself when you may encounter your supervisor, even if there are other people present.  He has isolated you for assault once, and may do it again. </li>\n<li>Find some good resources on abuse and familiarize yourself with their information and recommendations.  One site that I would recommend as helpful is: <a href=\"http://www.abuseandrelationships.org/\">http://www.abuseandrelationships.org/</a>.  Even though you are not in a sexual relationship with your advisor, a) your supervisor just attempted to start one, and b) you <em>are</em> in an important relationship due to the student/advisor connection.</li>\n<li>If you can, begin consulting with a professional therapist or counselor with a good reputation for helping victims of assault and abuse.  Having a trustworthy and professional third party will be very valuable for helping you get a clear perspective on your situation and figuring out what is the right path for you, as well as helping deal with any emotional repercussions of your assault. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you've taken all of those other steps, you will need to decide which of several paths you want to take, ranging anywhere from filing formal charges against your supervisor to quietly changing supervisors to simply protecting yourself and carrying through to graduation.  Unfortunately, all of the choices you make are likely to risk serious negative consequences to you, and only you (hopefully with aid from an experienced and supportive therapist or counselor) can decide which path and which risks are the best choice for your situation.</p>\n"

But, modelling in a specific field seems to me to be the role of the domain specialist.</p>\n<p>Then, what is the utility of an applied mathematician when domain specialists would (should?) be the people who tackle, solve, and model the problems related to their field of expertise? Where do applied mathematicians fit into the research puzzle where domain experts do not?</p>\n\n\nAssistant:",
        "golden_answer": " <p>I am mostly going by your title question and your clarification from the comment. Because as it turns out, the only field most applied mathematicians add knowledge to is applied mathematics itself, only then someone else to apply this knowledge to something later, so there is a lot of internal stuff going on. But more about that later. First let me tackle the part of applied mathematics that is &quot;exposed&quot; to the sciences. (By which I choose to mean everything except maths for sake of simplicity)</p>\n<h1>What do applied mathematicians do with respect to sciences?</h1>\n<p>If you want to apply mathematics to something, there are essentially two (oversimplified) steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write down a model of your problem. (e.g. differential equations, graphs, minimization problems, etc.)</li>\n<li>Extract useful information from your model using maths. (e.g. find solutions, universal properties, minimizers, numerical approximations etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>People from the sciences¹ are certainly good at the first step, and they are taught a bit about the second step during their education or pick something up in practice. But that is generally restricted to some standard methods. In contrast think of applied mathematicians as kind of the opposite of this. The model a mathematician writes down might be a bit rudimentary and not be most realistic one, but he'll certainly know some more advanced mathematical trickeries to extract some additional predictions from it. And of course as lifetimes are limited, it is basically impossible for someone to get into the full depths of both sides.</p>\n<p>Now one would think that this would lead to a clear division of labour. But what muddies the waters is that there are many models and not all of them are created equal. There are many models that may look reasonable but that are mathematically ill-posed, rendering their predictions useless.² There are also many models that look simple and are of interest to scientists, but where extracting mathematical information is impossibly difficult, while a less straightforward looking model might be easier to solve. (And for the converse, there are many mathematical toy-models with interesting theorems but no real applications).</p>\n<p>People who focus on this would generally fall under the heading of mathematical modelling. But that is only a small part of applied mathematics.</p>\n<h1>What problems are applied mathematicians concerned with?</h1>\n<p>Contrary to your question, a lot people in applied mathematics don't deal with specific real world problems at all. Rather than that they work on improving the methods used for problems. These can be ways to prove certain classes of theorems and make predictions or they can be algorithms to numerically solve problems. Both are completely different but kind of have the same function for the sake of this discussion.</p>\n<p>The important point is that the good methods are application agnostic. I don't want to prove a new theorem for each new application and I don't want my numerical algorithm to only work for a specific equation (there are some exceptions but those are by necessity, not by choice). So while many may look to some application as an inspiration or put it in the paper as an example, that is not their focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>¹As a sidenote, you called them &quot;domain specialists&quot;, but that isn't a good distinction, as this is true for both sides. Applied mathematics splits in many domains and each mathematician will only be a specialist in one or two of them (e.g. statistics, or partial differential equations or, certain numerical methods etc.). They just might feel like &quot;jacks of all trades&quot; to you, because each of those domains will have some applications in almost all sciences, but they are still rather specific and fundamentally useless if the problem needs a different subfield of methods. Think of the two as orthogonal to each other.</p>\n<p>²If a model M has no solutions, the sentence &quot;Every solution to the model M fulfills property X&quot; is true for any X.</p>\n"
