    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: My drunk neighbors (a male/female couple) took offense to a joke I made and assaulted me, and the gf capped it off by smashing/shattering an empty 40 oz bottle over my head...I declined to press charges after it happened but I'm conflicted. This happened early Saturday AM.  I sarcastically gave my neighbor's roommate the worst answer I could think of when she asked if we knew where he had snuck off too after a heated argument (normal for them to do) and I too pokerfacedly told her he had announced his intention to go cheat on her at the 24 hour \"massage\" parlor down the street.  She thought I was serious, and her roomie asked me if he really said that.  I told him no, of course not, and he tells me that I better flag her down cuz it seems she thought I was serious.  I feel bad about making the joke for many reasons, and would've apologized even despite what followed.   I was unable to catch up to her and so I returned to my apartment.  The BF soon after begins banging on my door in a way that I immediately realize that he seems far more angry than I had hoped.  I was gonna apologize anyway, and I figured I would just go out there like a man and address it.  He won't give me a chance to talk, basically pulls me by the shirt and starts very forcefully pushing me, obviously is drunk but livid in a way that indicated he was either high on something else (AFAIK they only drink and smoke weed but...) or that anger was a familiar and maybe inordinately intense emotions for him as a person.  I didn't wanna fight, and it was seeming like I may have no choice.  He's getting frustrated that I won't throw the first punch, I'm doing everything I can language wise to calm things down without patronizing him or invalidating his anger, but then he acts like my willingness to apologize is him making me apologize cuz I'm a pussy I guess he said for not fighting (just trying to get me to throw a punch I figure so I don't respond.), He says I shouldn't be apologizing to him and I agree and then his gf steps out onto their porch.  She is batshit insane livid, like I have never even seen in my 31 years a person so undeniably furious.  She then says she's got something for me in the house and I figure it's a weapon or something intended to harm me.  Their friends watching this happen are telling me what a piece of shit I am and accusing me of trying to elicit sympathy etc, and I am starting to realize they don't recognize my confidence or give a shit that I'm doing what I can (enough at that point, I still think, as the beer poured on my head was humiliating enough and I didn't know what I could do to assuage the anger at that point aside from going back in time and stopping myself from making the joke.  I'm trying to keep an eye on where the gf is and what she went in to retrieve, but it's difficult as I'm STILL getting pushed over and over by the bf.  I start turning to check on the GF and turn in time to see her swing a big ass glass thing as hard as it seemed she was able to, upside my head, causing a moment of static and a feeling that I was about to go unconscious, feeling hot blood pouring down my face before I even hit the ground.  There was a LOT of blood, and I assumed the wound pretty bad by the amount of blood and the thoroughly shattered glass fragments.  The facial expressions of my assailants and their friends seemed to bring gravity to the situation.  The bf says \"you're lucky it was empty!\"  But I can tell he's internally like \"WTF did she go that far for\" and he starts telling her she didn't have to do all that, and she is still livid and yelling at me all kinds of shit.  I'm starting to go into a near state of shock, and the desperate search for something to put over the wound to stem the bleeding makes me wonder if I have any other choice but to call an ambulance.  I wake my roommate, she can't take me to the ER cuz we can't leave her baby alone, and soon after I call 911 as she cleans up my blood for me.  Soon the cops arrive, I give them my account of the incident, and the paramedics arrive and act like I shouldn't have bothered calling 911 as there was \"nothing to suture,\" to which I assured them the blood smeared on my clothing, face and body were definitely real, but I was glad it wasn't as bad as I thought.  The police officers asked if I wanted to press charges, and I think before I act and I was pretty sure I could change my mind later, and the fact that by doing that I would be complicating and probably prolonging something for which I never wanted or intended for anyway, made me decide to not file charges at the time.  The police officer's reaction seemed like they were having a ddifficult time maintaining his air of impartiality.  The next day I heard them talking about the incident in a vocal tone that indicated they thought it was funny and like 'that'll learn em\" type of attitude.  They normally play music on Sundays pretty loudly, but they seemed (could be my psychology at that time I admit) to be cranking it up more than a bit more than is normal, which I have no problem with before 10pm but if they're doing it to be belligerent then I am pissed.  I got advice from a few friends and mostly they gave me the whole 'man if that was me they'd be int he hospital cuz I'd beat them up so hard' BS, but pretty much all of them said they would press charges if they were me.  I completely agree with the idea that what they did, especially her, was beyond what I deserved, but I still feel like an ass and I try to make extra efforts to swallow my pride/compromise/maintain good relations with especially family, coworkers, and neighbors, but I am a person who is trying to self-advocate and improve my self-image and actually realize my value so I don't get walked all over and disrespected.  They never even sent a person in their house to apologize, I'm sure they feel I completely deserved what I got, and I'm pretty sure they assume they did some badass shit and didn't suffer any consequences..they both had obvious anger issues,which I already had observed living next door.    I'm thinking I should consult a lawyer too, but she could've killed or disfigured me for life, and they show no signs of acknowledging that it took a lot of compassion to decline filing charges, and I hoped that they would be grateful once sober that they dodged a serious bullet that could easily put both in jail for a decent stretch of time, I assume around 2-5 years or less but even a month in prison/county has to be shitty and frightening.    My question is kind of mostly regarding ethics I suppose, but I have a very bad/good habit of thinking carefully about whether or not I will react like this or that to something, and though it means I frequently exercise opening my mind to other perspectives, it creates just as much chaos in my life when it inevitably causes me to procrastinate and too frequently second guess myself, which helps me little in my social interactions.    I'm worried that the restraining orders I will have to file against two people who live about 15 feet from where I am typing this from, the lack of witnesses that are likely going to tell the truth about everything as they were drunk & blindly on the side of the couple without hearing anything contrary.  I didn't go into the ER or urgent care as I trusted the EMT's knew what they were saying when they told me there wouldn't be any need to go in unless the cuts were aggravated in whatever way.  But the wound's location and the luck over where it's located make it seem unlikely any photographic evidence would be helpful in successfully pressing charges....  So is it important to/still worth it in light of my goals to be a better self-advocate  that I follow through on pressing charges?  I'm also apprehensive because obviously they could go away and cause trouble for myself and the other roomies in my household from the inside of jail, or what if the neighbors' household fabricates a story that I was the one who assaulted them etc...I'm wondering if it's all really worth it?  The GF and the BF have anger issues that at other times have surfaced and caused me to take notice, and they are in their early 20's and I don't feel like it would make me feel much better were they in prison, but a few friends I've explained this to have basically told me they would lose respect for me should I not press charges.    If I should press charges, answer me this:do I need to get my ass to urgent care so that I at the very least have some evidence aside from witnesses who might claim they saw nothing and photographs that barely show the (low-mid) severity of the cuts and bump?  What else do I need to do?   TL;DR   My neighbors assaulted me, one with what is possibly a deadly weapon.  I declined at the end of the arriving officer's questions to press charges for assault, but I am conflicted about it big time because I could've been killed or disfigured, but also am in some way the instigator or things with my innappropriate joke/statement, and the extenuating circumstances of my relation/literal location to the offenders makes me worry that I may wish down the line I'd just swallowed my pride and stick with my original decision to not file charges.    Thank you for any advice or anecdotal info you might throw my way!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Man, like 99% of what you wrote was not necessary.  First of all, it is up to the DA to press charges or not.  However, cops commonly ask you if you want to because nobody wants to bother with the case if you are not wanting to participate and see it through.  Second, there is no need to get a lawyer as you don't really have any damages.  That they COULD have caused damages doesn't matter from a civil standpoint.  Third:  Personally I would have \"pressed charges\" when first asked about it.  However, having said that I would not, I would not reconsider and I would just let it go just because I like to be a man of my word and have that reputation, but that's entirely up to you."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [NJ/PA] Just found out 5yr old son is not mine, have been paying child support Hello Reddit, I am posting this question for a friend who received the results of a \"peace of mind\" paternity test today.  Five years ago my friend received a phone call from a (newly) ex-girlfriend alerting to him that she was pregnant. Being a stand up guy the two got back together and tried to make the relationship work. They stayed together until the baby was born and later split up (within the first year). New Jersey handled the custody and child support hearings. About two years ago the mother moved to Pennsylvania without alerting the court.  Neither mother, nor my friend, live in New Jersey now and the case was never moved. My friend now lives in CA with his new wife and new born son.   Upon seeing his new born he had a gut feeling his 5 year old may not actually be his. On the advice of a lawyer he conducted the paternity test (called a \"peace of mind\" test) and learned he is not the father.   He is devastated but will be pursuing the removal of his name from the birth certificate and the termination of his child support payments.   He is wondering what he can expect through the courts. We've heard terrible stories of men who have been lied to about paternity being held responsible for continued child support payments because the courts like to keep a support system for the child.   The mother is a bit rough. Fresh neck tattoo, knuckle tatts, a single mother, but does have the support of a well-off family. My friend and his wife are living with her (his new wife's) family just trying to make ends meet with their own new child.   They will be hiring a lawyer but want to know what the first steps should be. Does he keep this a secret from the mother(is there a reason) or must he immediately state his findings? Are they in for a big fight (how expensive/experienced of a lawyer should he be looking to hire). Will the judge for sure order a court appointed paternity test based on his independent finding or could even that be denied? Any chance for repayment of the five years or child support payments? Any reason they should push for the case to be moved from NJ to PA?  Thanks for your help. If there are specific questions that I cannot answer I will get the answers directly from my friend. This is all very emotional for him but I fear time is of the essence.\n\nAssistant:",

There have been numerous cases of courts deciding that the guy in your friend's position who have decided he needs to keep on paying child support, because the child would suffer in the absence of it.  He's not getting any money back, forget that.  Let me repeat: It is possible that your friend will be ordered to continue paying child support in this case.  Lawyer.  Now."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [TX] My wife has taken her stepdaughter, my biological daughter, and the police won’t do anything about it. Looking for some help here; my wife and I got into an argument and I left for a few minutes, as requested, to give her some space. When I returned, she was not here and was gone with our 2 kids, one is our child together and one is from a previous relationship of mine. I tried calling her and all of our friends/relatives and no one has heard from her. It has been 4 hours.   I tried calling the police and they told me she hasn’t been gone very long and it was more of a civil matter.   This seems like kidnapping since this isn’t biologically or legally her daughter right? I’m very concerned for my daughter.   Any advice would be great.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " From the police's perspective, your wife may have taken the kids and gone somewhere to cool off. She obviously could not leave the two year old ALONE at home when she did so, so if she wanted to stomp off in a huff, she had to take both kids.   Given that she is an authorised caregiver in a position of parental authority, even though she is not legally the full parent, the police are not likely to worked up about it unless she's gone more than 24 hours, if the ONLY matter of concern is that she has both kids with her. She doesn't technically have custody, no, but unless there is an order actively barring her from being alone with the kids, her taking the child for less than 24 hours will not qualify as kidnapping.  Is there any reason, in your opinion, to be concerned that your wife may do harm to herself and/or the children? If so, then that's what you need to focus on because that will light a fire under the police's tails. If you are legitimately concerned that she's going to drive the family off a cliff and they need to catch her immediately, it's a different situation than \"she's sulking\". But **don't say this unless you actually mean it!** Don't escalate this unreasonably just to exercise control over your wife because you're angry at her. If it is a REAL worry then absolutely leave no stone unturned."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Friend forced to have sex with boss while she was incapacitated My friend was interning during her summer while she was studying at university in Pennsylvania. Her boss was always very nice to her, and asked her to get drinks with him on her last day of work. They went to a bar, and got sufficiently drunk - where he admitted he was attracted to her. She brought up the fact that he's married, and he acknowledged it. He wanted her to come to his house to meet his wife. She agreed, and so they went to his place. My friend met the wife, and they all drank some more. At this point, my friend blacked out and can't remember anything that happened after this point. She only remembers her boss saying, \"you should take your pants off.\" She doesn't even remember if she did do that.  Next morning, the wife was dropping her off, and was extremely hostile with her. Turns out, the boss had sex with my friend, while the wife was watching. The wife also apparently made out with my friend. In the morning, the wife forced my friend to take a Plan B (apparently, the guy didn't use a condom). She somehow got a hold of my friend's phone number, social media handles etc., and harrasses her regularly - calls her names and insults her a lot.   My friend is afraid to take any kind of action as she does not want her parents to find out (she's an international student). What options does she have? Is it possible for her to proceed legally in the US without her parents ever finding out back home?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I would file a police report and complain to where she was interning. Yes, there's a lot you don't know, and yes they \\*may\\* have plausible defenses that could hold up in court. That said:  1.) It is very inappropriate, and the boss should be fired for this behavior. Period. If he is working through the university, this absolutely violates their code of conduct.  2.) There's a possibility it's happened more than once. The only way for authorities to piece together what's going on is to keep getting reports - maybe in isolation the act is defensible, but if this is something they've done to multiple interns, an investigation might shake out more facts to lock down a pattern of behavior.  Finally, save all messages, social media posts, texts, voicemails. From here on out, keep contemporaneous notes of any other calls or interactions  - where you were, what time it was, what was said, etc."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Neighbors won't stop ringing our bell [CA] Hey all, I realize this may be a very petty issue but my roommate and I are fed up and desperately just want it to stop. We are both law students at a public university and live in the graduate housing available, which for the last year has been fine. But for the last month one of our neighbors had been ding dong ditching us. It started the first couple times in the afternoon/evening. Both times I was standing next to the door and opened it immediately and no one was there/anywhere in the hall, but I saw our neighbors door closing. Since then it's progressively gotten worse, and seven times over the last month has occurred during the night. It's not accidental. The bell is rung three or four times in quick succession. We thought the bell was defective at first so we taped over it and everything stopped. But once I removed the cover, it started immediately again. I've tried to rush out and catch the person but I can never see anyone.   I've contacted housing and they said it was concerning and asked us to keep them updated but otherwise have done nothing. I'm so tired of being woken up at 4 in the morning by the doorbell, and to be honest, I find it frightening. I asked housing if I can install a camera and they said no because I can't damage the apt at all. I'm at a loss as to what to do. We have finals in two weeks and I don't want to be woken all night by doorbells. Is this something I can file a police report about? I know that seems like a wild reaction but our housing office tends to refuse to do anything about issues unless pressed by an outside party.   We have no idea who is doing this. We don't know many people in our building. We're quiet and keep to ourselves for the most part, and haven't hosted any sort of party or gathering for over 6 months.

    "golden_answer": " Covering your doorbell or having it disconnected is probably a good idea. I would expect whoever is doing this would just start knocking loudly, but at least that takes more effort and is likely to also alert the neighbors directly beside you (presuming that your immediate neighbors aren't the ones doing this).   Also, keep a record of every time this happens. Keep contacting whatever housing administration office you have. Present them with your records. Emphasize that this is an ongoing issue that is impacting your academic performance and making you feel unsafe in your apartment. Keep putting the onus on them to come up with solutions if they won't let you set up a camera."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: (va) My son stole a rare toy from my brother. My brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. What do I do? Right now my brother is threatening to \"sue\" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.  &#x200B;  Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal  &#x200B;  Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my \"little shit\" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.  &#x200B;  I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said \"not good enough\" and hung up.   &#x200B;  Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Neighbor is claiming they have an easement through my uncle's property. US/Ohio  Hello. I was hoping that someone may be able to advise me on easement laws in Ohio.  My great uncle has owned his property in Ohio for nearly 40 years. It was purchased from another family member.   Recently the family who owns the large wooded property behind my Uncle’s house have been approaching him saying that they have a 50 feet wide easement through his property. My uncle is very upset about this. These people have been very rude to both him and his wife. The part of his property they are claiming to be entitled to, has a large garden, well and other buildings on it.  I’ve not been able to find any detail about such an easement on the deed. It just says “the tract as surveys contains X acres, more or less, and is subject to all legal highways and easements of record.”  \\-Where can I find these “easements of record”?   \\-Also, 50 feet wide also seems oversized for an easement. I always thought easements were the width of a vehicle with a couple feet on each side???  \\-The family claiming to have an easement did not own that land when my uncle purchased his property. Their property is also not landlocked, as part of it runs along the road.  \\-The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.   \\-My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property. There is no easement described on the survey.  I’ve already advised my uncle to find a real estate attorney. He’s elderly and I’m trying to help him solve this problem. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. I do not practice in Ohio.  As a previous poster says the easement should be on record with the county recorder's office. However, It should have been conveyed to your uncle with a deed and likely should have been recorded if you have had a recent survey. Typically, in my jurisdiction, they research these things as part of creating the final documents. But this does not mean they can't make mistakes and miss these things. But they tend to be pretty reliable. This is what they do for a living after all.  So, new advice. First, I would not immediately believe a neighbor. While your deed says \"is subject to all legal highways and easements of record\", this does not mean there IS an easement. This is language to convey to the buyer that your are purchasing only what I, the Seller, have the rights to sell to you. It's a catch-all phrase so the Buyer knows there might be something you should have discovered when you bought this land that we didn't discuss at the time of sale.  Second, an easement does not grant universal access to something. Typically, they are crafted as small as is reasonable for the purposes. For example, if you share a common driveway, the easement would grant them access to regularly trespass over your land using the driveway. If you share a common utility hook up like a water main or sewage, it would grant them use and right to invade to repair it, but it wouldn't give them the right to regularly drive their car over the same property. So just because there is an easement, doesn't tell you what it gives them the right to do.  Third, an easement can expire. You can grant someone an easement for a term period. For example, you might grant someone an easement for a year so they can go over your property to build their house. Typically, you might see this in a subdivision where they might build houses in phases. In this case, typically the developer who owns all the lots and sells one and knows they will need to access it later while building on the adjacent property.  You might grant an easement for a period because they haven't complete their own egress from the property and you provide an easier access for a short period. So the language might terminate it naturally. In this case, if the language in the easement does not a have a termination date or set out a specific length, it is usually assumed to be perpetual.  Forth, an easement can be terminated by a change of conditions. For example, the easement says the person can run their water access until such time as they make repairs to the property. The point is that there could be a triggering event that ends the easement. Like above, it would only expire if there is specific language in the easement.   Fifth,I would not presume anything. I don't necessarily agree with one of the posters that this falls on your uncle to discover. While your uncle risks conflict and potential liability if there is an easement. Given there is a survey and a normal closing where it should have been discovered, he should feel comfortable excluding them from the property until they can show he is wrong. It would be in his best interest to call the county recorder and do a little research. But I do not feel he needs to go to extraordinary means to find out if something does not exist.  The thing about property is that almost all (really all but there might be some weird reason in your jurisdiction) of the time actions involving property have to be in writing and they have to be recorded for them to be valid. This is to avoid exactly this situation. People can make a promise a lot of times. They can write even a note or contract that grants someone access. But because any owner of land only owns it temporarily and the land exists forever, in order to bind someone to a forever agreement, that agreement should be fair for everyone to discover who might be bound by that agreement. Even if your great-grandfather wasn't born at the time of the agreement. So if it's not in writing at the recorders office, the easement doesn't exist.  Finally, there might be some minor really detail issues like adverse possession and prescriptive easement that might click in here. But really, these might be something you ask your attorney if this escalates and are very fact specific.  And that leads to my parting advice. If this escalates, have your uncle get a land use attorney for this issue. While most lawyers will know how to deal with the normal stuff, a land use lawyer really will know how to navigate it much more effective. These guys typically have specific local knowledge that makes them worth it.  I hope this helps and adds to the good advice of others here.  Good luck!"

The car was NOT towed away. The city that it was towed in stated that the car was reported repossessed. Guy claims he has the pink slip and owns the car. (We have the pink slip). Number and business given to us by Police Department lead to a dead line, and the lot has been closed for 2 months. The car was effectively stolen and nobody can help us because the city of \\~\\~blank\\~\\~ reported it as repo'd, which means we can't even report stolen to our insurance.      List of facts:   \\-Mom is not on great terms with ex.   \\-We last saw the car on Sunday, the 14th.   \\-The Police department was shown \"proof\" (their words) that this vehicle was repo'd via a call.  \\-Car was repo'd Tuesday afternoon, the 16th  \\-We weren't notified until the 17th.   &#x200B;  So, we call ex Wednesday morning to get the car back so that we can get some general maintenance done on it cause it's an old bmw and burns oil lol. And she tells us if it's a joke, and that we \"already had the car since yesterday\" and that \"everyone saw us take the car\". This is not true because my mother was with me the whole day on tuesday, and then I went to work. So we go on high alert, and go to ex's house to see if she's just fucking with us to try and get us to see her again. She only has the keys. She claimed that we drove off the bmw with our spare keys but...we don't have spare keys for the car. Only one pair of keys, which are the ones that she had. We take the keys and call the local police department, and they tell us that the car was repo'd under the company name of \"Image Auto\" and given a number that leads to a dead line.      So we call back and ask for the number that the guy called from. We call that number, and some guy that sounds like the redhead from megamind answers. We ask him if he knows anything about a blue bmw, he says he doesn't. We end the call and call back the police, they redirect us to the records department in the city sheriffs office. They even tell us that this is very new to them and that they've never seen this before. The sheriff then calls the number, and the comes back to us saying that the guy claims that he owns the vehicle, and has the pink slip. It was now a civil matter, and out of their hands. So we go the DMV to get any information on this.      DMV prints out the history of the vehicle and proves that there are no leans on the vehicle and that it belongs to my mother and I, and the only other person in the history is the person we bought it from as a prior owner for a handful of years before. That is it. There is nothing else on the list.      Now it becomes a legal matter again. But the police department refuses to help us because we don't have the original pink slip. Of course we don't have the original pink slip. The DMV kept it when they sent us the new one when we did the title transfer. I don't know what we can do. We already reported the whole situation to the DMV as fraud but...like, all we have in terms of the guy is the name Tony, and his company lot. That's it. We know nothing else. We were told that the dmv would send out an investigator some time next week. We just want to see proof that this guy has some kinda lean on our car.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Invested in a house with ex and his parents that the ex and I lived in. He cheated (again), I left. They sold the house, gave me nothing and used the profits to buy him a different house. When my ex and I moved in together for the first time (after dating over 6 years), our credit was not good. His parents got a loan in their name to purchase a home, we put in all the money. Nothing was put into writing prior to the deal. Ex put in $17,000 and I put in $7,000 towards the down payment and other expenses (inspections, earnest money, etc). I paid the mortgage every month we lived there (@$13,000). I painted, purchased light fixtures and assisted in every step of the process when fixing up the house. Bought the house at $140,000. When the house sold, we owed $122,000 and they sold the house for $160,000.   I got an email from the ex’s mom prior to sale price going public saying they took a loss and NO ONE was getting anything back. They claimed they had put in $12,000 (which is false) and they were losing all of their money, the ex was losing all his money and so was I. Made me giggle, at the end of that email, she forgot to delete a sentence from her draft saying “you will get a $1,000 and nothing more”. I got zero as they clearly changed their minds. Turns out, I was the only one who lost all my money because they took all profits from the sale of our home and used it as a down payment for a new house for him. Mommy and daddy co-signed and bailed out their abusive cheating alcoholic son yet again.... from day 1, the ex has lied, said he got nothing and is renting his current house. All lies.  I have emails where she admits they were not supposed to put in any money, that the house was theirs in name only. She made up “charges” that I owe them like disposal of a piano I left at the house - the ex just admitted to keeping it as a “project”. I have receipts and cancelled checks, the mortgage company understood the arrangement as did the initial realtor. Taking into account there was no contract between us, do I have any legal recourse? In addition to the email where she (generally) admits the arrangement, I believe there is a good chance I could get the real estate agent to attest to my version of the events.   Side notes - not sure any of this matters but, some additional detail... my new job had paid a total of $50,000 for me to move and that included paying the portion of my previous mortgage that was upside down. The reason I left was he was an alcoholic and the relationship got progressively abusive. he was a serial cheater and I moved out specifically when I found out he slept with his coworker while we were living together (again, this was ongoing) in the parking lot outside the building they worked in. Despite everything, I was trying to be fair and only asked for $4,000 from the sale which was 1/3 of what I believed the profits to be AFTER the ex and his parents got their money back first - i wasn’t even including my initial $7,000 investment. They sold the house because the ex could not afford the $1,100/month mortgage. After I moved out, mommy and daddy paid the mortgage for him because he couldn’t.   I think you can gather from my post - I’m bitter. I’m pissed that he cheats, takes the money and now owns a home when I had to take a loan off my retirement to be able to get a security deposit so I could rent a place for my kids and i. Honestly, I don’t need their money, it not even about that anymore - I want vindication that I am not crazy - I need someone else to see through their lies and gaslighting.

This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me \"Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true\".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.  Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds. What are the odds of suing a top-tier public research university with a multi-billion-dollar endowment and coming out ahead?  I'm in Texas if that's relevant.\n\nAssistant:",

He has 3 kids with her and she has one kid with another guy from before him. About 5 years ago the kid who isn't his was taken away from her due to her being an unfit parent. The kid's dad won full custody. He is divorcing her and seeking custody of the 3 kids. She has pretty much left him and the kids and gotten into some drug/bad group type deal. She was never a good person but love is blind I guess.   He needed a divorce and custody lawyer. He called the lawyer who represented the dad of the kid who isn't his that won the custody case and gotten the kid taken away. He figured that is a great choice as she already knows his soon to be ex-wife and won against her.   He called the lawyer's office and gave a quick brief and made an appointment to have a consultation (or whatever it is called) with the lawyer.

I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with this type of thing - I know the city can use eminent domain if they want the land but I don’t understand why they would be doing this.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Attorney here. I'm a land use and real estate attorney. You need to consult a licensed attorney in this specialty in your area now. I'm sorry this will not be cheap, but it is necessary.  For background: the US Constitution requires that if the government is going to take your property, that it compensates you for the taking. We often think about the physical taking of land to build a new school or highway.  But, the government can also engage in what is called a regulatory taking. This is when the government passes laws so strict that it renders the value of your property useless (there is case law formulas to figure this out).   Let's say that the government rezoned your land from single family residential to industrial, would you have to change your use of the property? No, you would be grandfathered in (the official term is called a lawful nonconforming use to subsequent regulations). But- if your house burned down, would you be able to rebuild? Maybe, this depends on your state case law. Some states would say the insurance payout to rebuild can be applied anywhere and you can buy a new home somewhere else that isn't zoned industrial.   But, if your house burns down and you still own the land even if you can't build a house on it, how is this not a regulatory taking? It isn't because a court will likely hold that your land still has value and can be sold and developed for industrial uses (it is possible that an industrial designation would still be a regulatory taking if it is unrealistic for any developer to ever use the property for such. Factors to consider would be the size of the property, the road width for trucks to traverse, the availability of other undeveloped industrial areas, etc.)  So what is the concern with open land designation? Well, it may restrict you from making any new improvements to your property AND if your property was ever destroyed, you wouldn't be able to rebuild and there wouldn't be any value to a buyer in your open land. This is likely a regulatory taking."

After 2 weeks we came across a post on Facebook, a guy was claiming that his 12 year old cat came home after being missing for 2.5 years.  The woman that took the cat, lives 5 doors away from me, she claimed that the cat walked into her house, and she called her ex boyfriend to come and pick up the cat. So she confirmed that she took the cat and gave it away.   Since then we have been in contact with the ex boyfriend, we asked to view the cat as it looked a lot like our cat. At start of our conversation he sent us more pictures of the cat and we were positive it is our cat. So we asked again if we could see the cat, he refused aggressively. But in the end he agreed to meet at the police station, we asked him again to see the cat in person and he accepted, we come to his house and we see that it's 100% our cat.  We also found a photo of the cat that he claims came back to the after 2.5 years of being missing, and it's 12 years old.  We had a verbal agreement to go the vet next day and verify that the cat is not 12 years old and is 18 months old. But he blew us off and started threatening us if we keep contacting him.   That same day a man shows up to our door claiming to be a vet and saying that the ex boyfriend has emotional issues and that he is emotional unstable. The vet then started asking us  if we could leave the cat with him out of good will. We are completely shocked with how unprofessional that \"vet\" was. And he got our address without our consent from the woman that took the cat the vet also confirmed that.   We went to the police but they say their hands are tighed. The cat is not microchipped but we have all the photos to prove we also got it from a friend that fosters kittens. And the ex boyfriend and the woman does not have any other photos of their missing cat than the ones we found on their social media.   We are looking for any help with this.  Our next step is to get a solicitor involved.   We are based in Ireland.  Thanks\n\nAssistant:",

Not to mention, this is the Bay Area, where rent everywhere is ridiculously high. I found someone to sublet for April and May, but none of the debt has been covered.

    "golden_answer": " Right now, the best thing to do is to concentrate on the immediate. Things like those ashes or taking care of yourself and friends & Family.  When someone dies intestate (without a will), state law determines the heirs. You are his sole heir.   Here is some boilerplate on what has to happen:  When he died, everything he owned became the property of something called \"Estate of Dad’s Name.\" Someone has to be formally appointed to be in charge of his estate. Until that appointment is made, no one has the right to dispose of or give away anything that belongs to the estate. You, by law, would have first priority to be considered for the appointment.   Technically, you don’t have the right to clean out the house until you are appointed, but since you are the sole heir, no one will care. Be sure you make a list of things that may have serious value (jewelry, antiques, a coin collection, etc.), as well as any vehicles or firearms.   Once appointed, the representative must inventory his assets and debts, use the assets to pay the debts, and distribute what is left to the legal heirs (that is, to yourself). That's \"probate.  To be appointed, you must petition the probate court in the county where he lived. Although you can do it yourself, most people find that it’s better to have a probate attorney help you. Since you don’t live in the area, the attorney can act for you in many ways and save you travel.   Many attorneys are doing video or phone consultations these days. The attorney fees will be paid out of his estate, but the attorney may want un upfront retainer.  You should immediately notify any accounts he had, such as his bank or brokerage, credit cards, cell phone carrier, doc. You can’t access the account until you are appointed, but they can freeze it to prevent identity theft."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: (Long Island, New York) I just called off my wedding with my fiancé and I am stuck in a condo we both own My ex and I bought a condo last May two months before I proposed to her. Long story short, living together has been difficult to say the least and I had to call off our wedding. In February, we were approved for a domestic partnership so that she can be on my insurance. I just called the wedding off last month and we can’t come to an agreement on what to do with the condo we are living in. We both co-signed the place and put down $20,000 each. Her father is a carpenter and completely renovated it free of charge.   Now that we are broken up we can’t come to an agreement what to do with the place and it’s getting nasty. I offered to buy her out of the $20,000 and she says she wants $33,000 (cost of labor for her father and furniture she bought) up front or she’s not moving out because I broke up with her. I have been paying the monthly mortgage ($1385) on time and she has been paying for the monthly home owners fee (initially $300 but they raised it to $500 three months ago).

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [AK] After an ugly 4 yr long custody battle, I have not seen my children for 3 years. I just found out that my 12 year old son is dying from cancer, and my ex is refusing me access to medical information and visits to my child. I apologize in advance, there is no easy way to explain this story, this will be a wall of text. I will endeavor to keep it as brief and relevant as possible.   I was married for 10 years to a narcissistic, abusive, sociopath. Most of the abuse leveled at me was emotional/intimidation, but he was physically abusive to my daughter from a previous relationship, and our three sons. When I moved out, he physically attacked me, nearly breaking my arm and causing extensive soft tissue damage. This is relevant later.   In 2005, our oldest son died of leukemia. He was 2. In 2009, our middle son was diagnosed with lymphoma. He successfully completed treatment and has been in remission for nearly 7 years.   We separated in 2009, right after my sons treatment was finished, and filed for divorce shortly after. I filed a DV report when he attacked me. He hired a criminal defense attorney, absolutely assassinated my character, convinced my mother to testify against me, as well as our blind elderly neighbor who \"saw\" the entire incident. The case was dropped.   During the divorce hearing, I filed for full custody. In Alaska, in most cases, that automatically guarantees the other parent will get custody (if they are asking for 50/50 joint custody). I did not know this at the time, and my lawyer pushed for full because of the DV hearing. The judge reviewed the files/recording, decided on the spot I was a liar because the other case was dropped, and awarded joint custody.   For four years, my ex dragged me back to court for every excuse he could find, to complain about my unwillingness to cooperate and co-parent with him. He paid a counselor (a substantial cash payment, outside of our insurance coverage, with additional gifts such as fishing trips and work done to his property) to testify against me in court. I did not find out until much later that the counselor was practicing with a suspended license for ethics violations (false testimony in other family court cases) the entire time he was \"treating\" my children. Every time we went to court, I lost more and more rights/privileges.   In 2013, he filed multiple abuse investigations with OCS, culminating in a police investigation and restraining orders being filed against me after I returned my children to him with bruises (bruises were NOT from abuse, the children stated that, OCS stated that, and the doctor that examined them stated there was no way to conclude they were the result of abuse). However, I did admit in court to spanking my children, with my hand, 1 time over the week the bruising occurred.   By this time, the judge was not even bothering to hide her disgust for me every time we came to court. She stated that in the case of the spanking, it was a violation of the no corporal punishment clause in our divorce decree (true), that my children were in fear for their lives because they behaved immediately afterward, and that the spanking met the definition of assault. She granted a one year protective order against me, ordered parenting classes, a domestic violence intervention program, mandatory counseling, and reduced my visitation to 6 supervised hours per week, with a supervisor of my ex's choosing.   I completed all ordered services. My ex, however, refused to comply with the visitation. Or rather, he made visitation so logistically and physically impossible, he might as well have refused. He always made it clear that when I could not meet his conditions, it was MY refusal to comply, not him denying access.   With the help of my counselor, I made the decision to walk away. This entire situation was a narcissists dream - he maintained all control and could \"punish\" me for leaving through my children. By removing myself from the power struggle, even knowing that he was not a good person, or a good parent, the hope was he would drop his obsession for controlling me, and focus on raising our boys in a healthier atmosphere. It is the hardest decision I have ever made in my life.   I did get behind in child support for some time, as I had a hard time finding work. But it was paid whenever I was working, and not only has it been paid consistently for nearly two years but all of my arrearages have long since caught up. I have had absolutely zero contact with my ex or my children in just over three years.   I found out over the weekend that my 12 year old son, after being in remission for 7 years, has relapsed, and is in very poor condition. At 12, my son weighs 56 lbs. he has always been a small child, but he is the size of an average 6-7 year old. My ex so stubbornly refused to take him to the doctor, despite OBVIOUS signs of illness, including a tennis ball sized mass on his chest, that when the cancer spread to his spine and began putting so much pressure on his brain that he is exhibiting stroke symptoms (face drooping, balance issues, slurred speech), my ex still sent him to school, and the school had to intervene and refuse to allow him back until he had a doctors clearance. My younger son is also displaying some rather alarming signs of abuse/mistreatment.   At this point, their father still refuses to contact me to tell me about our sons health. He is blocking my attempts to access medical records or speak with the doctors. He has told others that if I try to go to the hospital he will have me arrested (he can't, but he can cause a huge scene and upset my son).   I have applied to legal aid previously, and was denied - custody cases are rarely given assistance by legal aid here. I cannot afford an attorney. I pay 52% of my income to child support. I barely eat, but I will do whatever I have to to support my kids.   I know I need to speak with an attorney. I have left messages for several that friends have referred me to in the hopes that one will consider a pro bono representation, or allow some sort of payment arrangements. Other than that, any advice on how to proceed at this point, or resources in Alaska I may not have found, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAssistant:",

The sellers can put their belonging into storage, and move into a hotel, motel, or camp on the side of the road.  Your mom, through her attorney, need to start the eviction process immediately.  What if the sellers never qualify for their financing?  What if they need another 4 months to find another house, close on it, and move?  What is your Mom left to do - wait?  > The realtor has no real answer and the seller told my mother she technically has 30 days from closing to be moved out.  Your mom should ask both the realtor and the attorney where that is stated in the closing documents?  The realtor may just be blowing your mom off.  Why would your mom close on the property with real money that she is probably paying a mortgage on if she can not take possession for 30 days?  That makes no sense.  > They've stated that with the postponement that their work and personal life doesn't allow them to be moved out until at least next week.   Not your mom's problem.  The sellers can take vacation time starting today and move out.  She needs to speak with her attorney about eviction and also charging the sellers for their non-performance.  I'm sure that the sellers would be more than willing to give the money back to your mom until they are out of the house (try that line out on the sellers and their realtor)."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Hired beekeeper to remove bees from property. It turned out to be African Killer Bees and they swarmed the neighborhood and killed a neighbor’s dog. (TX) Recently inherited some property and I was made aware by the tenant that there were bees in the shed. After calling around to several beekeepers I managed to find one to hire to remove the hive. Neither I or my tenant were present on the property during the removal. The beekeeper began inspection of the hive and had to cut a apart of the shed off to investigate. Beekeeper didn’t know it was Africanized bees until they began to swarm. He was in a bee suit but the bees swarmed around and killed the neighbors dog. We believe the dog was chained up (illegal?) and that’s why it couldn’t escape because the property is not fenced in. Fire department was called to spray down the bees and get them out of the air. The queen was collected. Neighbor is pissed he wasn’t informed of the removal (he was aware of the existence of bees).   My self and the keeper are afraid we can get sued. Am I liable here? Is the beekeeper liable? The neighbor has a history of suing companies in the past.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yes, you and the beekeeper can both be sued.  Pretty much anyone can be sued for anything in the US.  But the most they would be able to collect is the value of 1 dog of similar age/breed.  So unless it's some super rare exotic show dog with lots of paperwork somewhere between a few hundred dollars and a few thousand dollars is the maximum they could collect if they sued and won.  If they sue, odds are your home owner's insurance would cover your liability, usually you would have somewhere between $50,000 and $1,000,000 of liability coverage on your policy.  They would provide a lawyer if it went to court and would pay out if a settlement was reached.    I have no clue if they would be likely to win in court or if your home owner's insurance would offer a settlement to avoid going to court.  The dog owner would argue that the fog was killed because your beekeeper disturbed the hive that you allowed to exist on your property.  However your lawyer would argue that bees are wildlife and you did not settle them there and were taking steps to remove them in a responsible manner and that their dog would not have died if it had not been tied up (if this is illegal it would be mentioned here) outside.  Probably not worth losing sleep over this one.  But if you get served with a lawsuit, don't ignore it and immediately contact your home owner's insurance."

I was baby sitting this child and he was playing with a sling-copter (http://www.slingcopter.com) with his friend, firing at each other with it.

You (and your girlfriend) were responsible for controlling the child and his behavior at the time. You knew they were flinging projectiles around the room. You chose to have an expensive electronic in the room with the kids flinging things around it. You assumed that risk. And from a childcare perspective, it really sounds like you weren't supervising the children properly. I'd be pretty pissed as a parent to have my babysitter come over with her boyfriend just so he can eat my food, find out that they were allowing my kids to fling stuff around my living room, and that the babysitter and her boyfriend were paying attention to their laptops and each other, and not the child I'm paying them to care for.   I've had kids I nannied break my stuff. One kid knocked my phone off the coffee table and broke the screen. I never once thought to ask the parents to pay for it. I was the one in charge at the time, I assumed risk by having my phone where the kid could reach it, I should have put it somewhere safer. I paid for it and was more careful in the future. When a different child I nannied broke two of his mom's bowls while I changed the baby's diaper, I actually paid to replace her bowls. It doesn't matter that her kid did it, I was in charge of the child when it happened and I should have supervised more closely.   Accidents happen, especially with kids.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: About a year ago, I took steps to disconnect myself from the world - had enough of nosy neighbors, constant contact from work, robocalls, etc. Wondering if maybe I took it too far in a legal sense. [USA] This past year has been the best of my life.  I transitioned to remote work not requiring supervision - so long as I produce results they pay me and there isn't much more to it. Doesn't matter where I am, what time I work, I don't need to be available for meetings (just read and respond to emails in a timely manner). I don't have any close family, no dependents, so no worries there. So I decided to live on the road, bought a big truck and a nice camper, customized and kitted it out, and have been on the road or in a campground ever since. The home I own is still my address, I go back there to check mail when it's convenient (usually every month or so). I still have my old phone number in case anyone needs to contact me - text messages are disabled and the phone stays off unless I'm checking voicemail, which is about once a week.  Anyways the reason I'm posting here is I just checked my voicemail, my neighbor left a message saying that her dog has drowned in my pool, that I need to respond to text messages and phone calls, and that the police are currently looking for me, that it's my fault for having too low of a fence and an uncovered pool, blah blah blah.  I'm not sure she even has a dog, and I am pretty certain that if this did happen it would not be my fault (especially considering that my pool was both empty and covered the last time I was home).  Anyways this got me thinking more generally:  1. How do I check to see if I have an arrest warrant?  2. Do I actually have any obligation to be directly accessible to callers?  3.

My question is, is this situation something I can sue the dog owners for? More info inside. To keep this as simple as I can, I've tried to shorten it without leaving any facts out.   I was delivering 2 packages to a house for Amzn. There were 2 \"docile looking\" pitbulls walking around with invisible fence collars on. Amzn leaves this up to driver discretion whether we continue to deliver or not. I get out of the van and deliver the goods to the front porch. As I turned to go back to my van, one of the dogs flipped his switch and proceeded to lock his jaw on my left hand. He then did it again but I finally got free after punching him in his head. I was yelling obscenities at this point and both homeowners come out to my rescue. The woman was extremely helpful with giving my medical supplies to wrap my hand. The guy was pretty nonchalant and even looked agitated by the whole situation. Animal control was called by home owner and so was the vet for shot records. I called my job and reported it. They sent me to fastmed (urgent care) to have my hand looked at, and its covered by workman's comp.   This honestly scared the shit out of me and I'm probably not going to continue this line of work anymore.   Would I have a case to sue the dog owners?   Things to note: Police we're not involved.

Thank you, Locationbot.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Talk to a personal injury lawyer.  North Carolina is a negligence dog bite state which means that whether or not there is liability on the dog owner is fairly fact specific and may require you to get the dog's animal control history.  Neither of those things is something that the internet can help you with but a lawyer can.  Personal injury lawyers charge on a contingency fee basis, which means that they take a percentage of whatever you get from a settlement and you pay nothing if there is no settlement.  The worker's compensation thing doesn't affect your ability to sue to dog's owner *if there is liability*.  Contrary to what the other poster is telling you, the fact that workers comp is paying the medical bills does not mean you have not sustained damages.    Damages from dog bite cases are difficult to evaluate just from a simple description because the medical bills tend not be very high, but the bite itself tends to cause lasting, compensable damage.  Again, a personal injury lawyer will be able to evaluate your case much better than the internet can."

Here are a few things the hygienist explained to me **beforehand**:  * There was a lot of buildup on my teeth, and I had some bone loss. * My cleaning would be more intense than a \"standard cleaning\".  Here is what the hygienist explained to me **during**:  * The cleaning was taking a while, and due to time, my cleaning would need to be split into two sessions.  It wasn't until **after** they had cleaned only the right side of my mouth that they explained to me the following:  * Because the cleaning was split into two different sessions, they will be billed as two separate cleanings. * Because they are two separate cleanings, I will be billed twice. * Because I am trying to get two separate cleanings within a 6-month period, my insurance will not cover the second cleaning.  That definitely caught me off guard. Nobody goes to get a cleaning expecting only half of their mouth to be cleaned. When they were done, I thought, \"I had half a cleaning today,\" not \"I had a cleaning today.\" I had assumed that because it was the same procedure, I would be billed once for it.  I spoke with another dentist who told me that splitting more intense cleanings into two sessions is a standard practice. Hygienists can make that decision at their own discretion for a variety of reasons (lack of time, comfort of the patient, etc.). I have no problem with that as a concept—I did, after all, agree to come back (before I knew that it would be billed twice).  When I spoke to the insurance company, they told me a few things:  * The dentist could have done it all in one session, and had they done so, I would have been billed once for it, and it would have been covered entirely. * It is the dentist's responsibility to contact the provider service to determine my benefits (which they did not).  I called the dentist office, and they refused to work with me. It feels like they are using my half-clean mouth as leverage. My only two options are to wait 6 months to clean the other half of my mouth or pay for the second cleaning.  I understand that there is nothing wrong with what they did from a dental perspective. My beef is that they did not do their due diligence of determining my benefits or transparently communicate their billing process until after they had already cleaned half of my mouth. Is there anything I can do here?\n\nAssistant:",

His wife is saying that she is entitled to half FL My husband's father owned a house outright prior to meeting and marrying his wife. They met in 2013 and married in 2014, but their relationship was on again off again. Most recently they were \"together\" from November 2018 to December 2019 before deciding to call it quits for good. She moved out of his place and into an apartment of her own, and they lived separately from that point on.  He filed for divorce in early 2020, but early in the process she had a series of tough life events. Her mother and sister both died and she herself was diagnosed with breast cancer. My husband's father stopped pursuing the divorce to give her time. He offhandedly mentioned at one point that he was waiting a while because it looks bad to divorce her when she's going through a difficult time, but once things got better for her he planned to pursue it because he said he wanted to date again.  In summer 2020 he went through some tough times himself, decided life was too stressful and retired to a condo on Florida. He gave my husband his house (and updated the deed etc. accordingly). If it matters, she was never on the deed.  Fast forward, he passed away in January of this year.   Then in May we got a surprise at the door - divorce papers. She apparently did not know he had died.  After she was informed that he had passed, we thought things were settled - but now we've received a letter from a law firm stating that she is suing his for the house. The letter named his dad (deceased), his \"estate\" and us as the defendants according to the papers. The gist of it seems to be that she is arguing that the house was half hers (because she wasn't on a deed but apparently by Florida law that's how it works, it claims) so he couldn't give it away without her permission, and therefore him giving it to my husband wasn't valid. Then further that since he died, Florida law says she gets the house.  As far as we can tell this is a \"we plan to sue you\" type letter rather than a \"we are actively suing you right now and have filed in court\" type letter.  Is this serious/valid? Should we get a lawyer or is it unlikely to play out? Thanks for any and all advice.\n\nAssistant:",

Awhile back I had some major health issues and required a few surgeries to resolve things, and because of that I had to take some time off work. Management knew the situation, why I would be out and when I would return to work. One manager sent an email to my coworkers, without realizing I was also on the email chain, saying that I was in the hospital because I had popped some pills and tried to overdose and end it all; he said I may not ever come back to work, since I may not wake up. I only know this because 1) I was on the email chain and 2) MANY coworkers starting reaching out, very very concerned for me and saying they hoped I would be alright and recover. This all seemed so odd to me until I saw the email chain. I have NO clue what compelled this manager to do this, other than I know he was very mad with me taking short term medical leave, because he told me that. But being suicidal and overdosing was NOT at all true, I was just having another surgery. When I came back to work things were just awkward with coworkers, trying to explain that somehow what this manager said was not true, many people welcomed me back and said they couldn’t believe I was alive - it was just so weird. I tried ignoring it but it really made the relationship with some coworkers a bit more awkward, as they really didn’t know what to believe, because why would a manager make something like that up? When I finally had the confidence to ask some general questions about all this to the manager he was clearly annoyed, he did not want to talk about it, and oddly enough the next morning I came in I was told I no longer had a job. Even though my contract was good for another year, it was abruptly ended, after I brought up my concerns about this entire situation to this manager. I could not help but think these are somehow related. Even if they are not, and they had a legitimate reason to get rid of me and my job, what was said about my health issues, the lies that were told, I think should have never happened. And now I worry that once I leave work, what this manager could try putting in my file that may prevent me from working elsewhere in the company in the future.

Any advice, even if it’s not entirely legal-advice is welcome. Thanks for reading this in advance.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " OP, FL attorney here. Go get a consult with a FL employment attorney, and pronto. I have seen similar situations before and think, practically, your position is there is cooked. But, you may very well have some cause of action. I would think, at MINIMUM, you have a cause of action for “defamation per se.”   Regular defamation can be hard to prove, because how do I demonstrate how I was “damaged” (ie, what was the financial impact of the defamation)? But defamation per se presumes damages because the statement is so injurious. Saying someone attempted suicide, subjecting them to distrust, disgrace, etc. is right there.    Examples of per se defamation include: When the statement charges that a person has committed an infamous crime; When the statement charges a person with having an infectious disease (or mental illness); When the statement tends to subject one to hatred, distrust, ridicule, contempt or disgrace; or The statement tends to injure one in his trade or profession.  See any similarities??  So if you can’t get to an attorney immediately — though, I would make this a priority — consider sending an anti-spoliation letter to the company, which is a letter demanding they preserve all evidence (including correspondence, documents, records, etc.) related to your employment and the circumstances of your termination, leave, etc. If you do this, be sure to specifically reference the emails from the manager that mention the “suicide attempt” and all replies, as well as the dates if known. You don’t have to mention the circumstances. You can simply say something like, “...including the [date] email from [manager] to [employees] with the subject line [“subject”], as well as all replies and forwards of that correspondence.”   This will out the company on notice that you are engaging an attorney and that they must preserve evidence. Manager may start trying to delete record of this. It also lets the company know that you know some of what transpired. It also puts managers above the person who spread this rumor on notice of his actions so they’ll begin to investigate.  Edit because the post is otherwise locked - OP, my post is slop because it was done quickly on mobile, but I think you get the gist. You may also have some contract-based action here. Please go speak to a good employment attorney about what I see as , at minimum, the following potential causes of action: (a) wrongful termination; (b) defamation/defamation per se; and (c) breach of contract.  Also, the most upvoted advice here is to “speak to HR.” I do NOT recommend this. You have already been terminated. That can only put them on notice (without it being in writing) that you intend to bring a claim. It’s bad advice IMO and I’ve reported it as a violation of this sub’s rules.   HR’s duty is to protect the company, not you. You do not work there. They will not be looking out for your interests. Even if you report this matter to them, and they terminate the manager, how does that help you? HR/the company in that instance would still only be protecting the company’s interests. The manager was acting as an agent of the company when s/he sent these emails and when you were terminated, not as an individual.   I do not practice employment law, but I do represent businesses. I would thank a terminated employee for putting me on notice of a potential claim. I would be able to prepare the company and any defenses before the first round ever began. My advice, again, talk to a reputable employment attorney before speaking to anyone at your company. You will be doing yourself a great disservice otherwise."

How you split the rent is between you and your husband. You will need to pay all of the rent and then you can sue the ex for his half. If you can't pay you will both end up with an eviction on your records so maybe that would be incentive for him to keep paying his half but no guarantee.  Start interviewing divorce attorneys and follow your lawyers advice."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: My ex-husband hired a private investigator to check up on my health. I've primary custody. Texas. We have a seven (7) year old.  It is summer so our son is out of school. He just saw him in June for his summer time, returned June 27th. He is stationed in Georgia with the military. Our son lives with me in Texas primarily because his father is often deployed and is stationed different places a lot.   I've had a string of bad health luck since contacting salmonella in late may.  First it was that, then a nasty cold, then the flu. (I work with young children and it isn't unusual for me to drag home the latest gunk that is going around but I've had a harder time getting over stuff this year). I've also lost a great deal of weight since April due to work stress and then exacerbated by the illnesses. It is fine. I was overweight before so now I am just under the overweight status.    I had some sick time saved up and my doctor suggested I take some time off , rest up and just get better.   I'm a high risk for a certain type of cancer but I do not currently have cancer. It is just something I need to get check yearly.  My ex-husband saw me when he brought our son back. He said I looked sickly. I agreed. I am just now getting over the flu. I feel weak. I feel awful. I assured him though that I had seen a doctor, a few times, and that I was following his advice.   He insisted taking our son with him because I looked gross I am not sure what he meant. I was sick but I was dressed and showered. The house looked clean as I had just had it professionally cleaned.        I usually enroll our son into a daycare during the summer so I can work but since I was going to be out on sick leave anyway and we have a large yard and he has friends and I am not bedridden then I thought it would be fun for him to stay in. Sure, we couldn't go camping when mom needs to be near a bathroom but we could do things. I have done things with him while sick. Hell, I've had a nasty cold, gone to work a full day and been a mom all afternoon and evening.  This is part of parenting.  I told him thank you but no thank you.   For the past two weeks he has been facetiming my son obsessively to ask about my health.    I am actually feeling a lot better and started running again ( I want to keep the weight off). My son rides his back with me while I run so it is a perfect family fitness thing.  I am going back to work next week even.   I made the mistake of answering one of his face times when I came in the house sweating. \"Are you on drugs he said?\"   So I hung up on him.   He called back to tell him me he has had someone following me and taking pictures. He actually  did send me a picture of me using the car to go get the mail which proves I am \" not able to walk long distances\". I don't know why I took the car. It is a long driveway and I guess I just didn't feel like walking at that moment.   It could have been taken when he was here. He usually stays in town for a day before flying back. Who knows?  He has even had our son take pictures of me and report to him anytime I am asleep while he is awake. So I can't nap now while a seven (7) year old plays in his room?      He says he thinks I am either having huge health issues that impede my ability to take care of my son or I am on drugs. I am neither. I just had a shit two months where I caught many viruses back to back and it sucked. Now I am recovering.   Our son is feed, we are out doing things, the house is clean.   I've stopped answering his facetimes (apart when he wants to talk to our son and I shut it down when he starts asking questions about my health).   He sent me a certified letter demanding a drug test with a threat to call protective services.   I don't know if he is still having me following. I have paid two visits to the doctor. One was for a check up since I've been sick. The other time was a simple refill on a cream for a existing and long term sick condition.   He did know about those two visits so maybe someone is still following me or he could have asked our son who went with me both times.   I know that I do have to make some disclosures to him, like if I had a cancer and was going to die (I do not), but do I not have some right to privacy?  Is he allowed to just have someone follow me like that ? Would a real private investigator even do that?  He has mentioned wanting primary custody for a while but with his deployments and being moved about I just didn't think it was best even though he makes more money than I do (his argument). Last time we went to court, a Texas judge agreed with  me and he stayed our current order.   I don't mind drug testing. It seems unnecessary. Is there a bar for that sort of thing? No court has ordered it yet but I don't want to seem like I am resistant to it.   Is there a right way to handle this? Or is it time to invest in a lawyer?\n\nAssistant:",

This seems to be an extremely bad thing to do and something that you may want to consider speaking with a lawyer about.  I am not a lawyer, however I see this as both placing your 7 year old in a parental position over one of his parents and using him/teaching him to be a confident/helper of one parent against the other. Being a child shouldn't be either of those. Since he went there, speaking with him directly may just escalate it... I personally would speak with a lawyer and, if the lawyer feels it would be appropriate, have the child speak with a child therapist who can document the situation through the child's eyes.  On a personal note, I hope that you continue to feel better and that you are able to get both this situation and your health resolved quickly."

(TX) I’ve been working as a seasonal employee for the last three years, and I recently decided to quit without notice.  An event came up three days before my shift and we’re supposed to provide written notice seven days in advance for a shift that needs to be covered. If this isn’t done, it’s a no-show, and a no-show is an automatic fire. An automatic fire is considered leaving without notice, so I jumped the gun and quit preemptively.  When I told my employer about my resignation, I was redirected to our hire packet, which has a clause that states that any quit/fire without notice is an automatic pay cut to minimum wage for all hours that have been unpaid. I was supposed to be paid for three weeks in two separate checks/pay periods as of the day I resigned, one for two weeks I had already worked and another for the two days before I quit. My employer cut my pay for both of them to minimum wage. I’m not sure if cutting pay is legal at all in the first place, and if it is i’m not sure if cutting pay for two separate pay periods, including one that had already been completed, is legal.  TL;DR, My employer cut my pay for the last TWO checks for quitting without notice. Is this legal?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [MI] Gas company’s contractor damaged my property and sidewalk, hasn’t repaired for months due to “concrete shortage” In September, my gas company began replacing gas lines in my neighborhood to the houses. I came home from work one day to find two of our concrete sidewalk segments had been removed, the patch of grass and soil at the curb completely dug out, a few other patches of grass destroyed in my lawn and divots in the soil created by their excavation equipment, large patches of my garden destroyed, and a puddle of lubricant from their equipment that remained on my lawn for a few weeks. A few days later they patched the sidewalk with asphalt but have not performed any repair since. There are about 50 houses in my neighborhood in similar states.  I have contacted the utility company (says they will have the contractor contact me directly) and the contractor several times since September. The contractor stated that they cannot complete the repair due to a “concrete shortage”. At this point I feel like I’ve been more than patient.  What concerns me the most is the asphalt sidewalk patch job, which has always been  uneven and a tripping hazard especially at curb cuts, is now starting to degrade ahead of winter. I noticed today in my neighbor’s sidewalk there is a hole roughly the size of a foot that looks just ready to break an ankle especially when it gets covered as snow.  Is there anything I can do to compel either the utility company or their contractor to repair my property or pay for someone else to repair? Also, are they opening myself and my neighbors up to potential litigation by creating hazards on the sidewalk?  I can provide pictures of any of this if it helps. Thank you!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Not a lawyer.  Spent the last 3 years as a superintendent.  There is indeed a concrete shortage, however, unless you're talking a huge section, a few panels wouldn't be more than a couple yards.  A full truck is 10.  They may be waiting until they can justify a full truck.  As other mention, try city contacts.  Code enforcement would be a good start. Some cities move faster if you mentioned ADA access.  If it's a trip hazard as you say, imagine someone who is blind or in a wheelchair.  That'll probably lead to them using a tow behind mixer and hand mixing the concrete from bags."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Neighbor's dogs killed my livestock. I want to file a small claim petition in Texas, but do not know where to start. Animal husbandry is the main source of income for me. I raise show quality and rare breed rabbits and exotic poultry that I intend to sell chicks from. I have other animals that are strictly pets. Sunday night, around 10:30p, I caught two large dogs on my property attempting to tear through the fence of my goat pen. It is goat fencing on the exterior with electric fencing on the interior to keep the goats from climbing the sides and getting out when penned at night. I yelled at the two dogs and ran inside to grab shoes and a flashlight. When I came back out, one dog was trying to get through a fence surrounding the open sides of my loafing barn (a horse stable-style barn with an open front and partially open sides) and the other was trying to jump over. That barn houses my senior laying hens and my herd of rabbits (approximately 80 valued at $100-350 each). My husband was threatening to shoot the dogs so I ran them off our property. IMO, the dogs are just being dogs and their owners should have kept them on their property. I began checking fencing and making sure everyone was okay when I found that they had torn open the side of one of my coops and killed my 24 exotic birds. I bought them as chicks in May (they were not cheap) and they were to begin laying in November at which point I would have sold the chicks to supplement my income. The Ayam Cemanis are valued at $150-200 each when mature and the BLRWs are typically in the $60-100 range for a mature bird depending on which farms have them available. Additionally, the coop that was destroyed was purchased pre-covid for $450 +tax and is now listed for $1163.66 (tax included). In total, damages were $3,748.66 not included the upcoming loss of income. Police came out to my home and we told them what happened, we took a ton of photos, and gave them a description of the dogs. For those wondering, I am in the process of buying a donkey to live with my animals and investing in outdoor cameras.  Then, around 1am, the dogs came back. One was on my back porch and another was trying to get through the fence into our rabbit barn again. This time, I was able to round them up with treats and secure them both to my dog's outdoor lead that keeps him from running off when we take him outside. They matched the description I had given to the original officers and I took photos of them and their tags with the owner's contact information. The officers attempted to reach the owners, but could not so the dogs were impounded and I was told to try to settle things with the dogs' owners on my own, but if they were uncooperative I could take them to Small Claims Court.   I reached out to the owner to explain my account of what happened, share the photos, and explain the financial hit her dogs caused my family. I told her I did not want to go to SCC and would prefer to settle things on our own. I also told her that I understood that it was a lot of money so I could work with her if she was willing to come to an agreement. I sent her links to where the items were being sold and told her she could purchase replacements from anywhere she wanted so long that it was the same coop and the birds were the same breed, sexes, and at least the age of the ones lost. I also told her that as long as she could have the birds replaced by November she could take her time on the coop. In a nutshell, she told me I was SOL and she had no money.  So, I want to move forward with SCC, but have no idea where to start. I live in Panola County, Texas. I filed two police reports and have numerous photos, the officers saw the damage and the dogs. Please give me any advice you can!\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Property law: my mom is being sued by the guy who bought her house from the guy who bought her house South Dakota. My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.  Guy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he’s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he’s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.  He’s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom’s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.  When my mom’s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she’d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn’t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left.   My mom isn’t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1’s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it—but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn’t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.  She then got an offer from a guy who’s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.  Now, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors’ property to be okay.   The properties have no distinct borders; it’s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it’s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it’s not encroaching on anything, and we don’t have to cross the property line to access it).   But my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad’s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it’s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don’t think so.  Anyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He’d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*  A-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she’d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he’d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that’s why A-hole2 hadn’t done the survey.  She got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1’s lawyer that they knew she hadn’t been dishonest and they just hoped she’d “pitch in” to move the garage like she’d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).  So, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again.   My mom got a summons served to her new house; again she’s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can’t control and that’s another topic) so she doesn’t ever just open the door.   She saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn’t; she told the person she didn’t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.  My mom’s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he’s bought every firm on this side.  So… my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer.   How worried should she be? How can I help her?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Not a lawyer but I would not pay him anything. He did not have an inspection nor survey.   It will be hard and she'll have to stand firm, but let him take her to court and let the judge hear the case.

So sorry about this situation when your mom should be coasting through the rest of her life. I wish her good luck and success with this case."

I am unsure if I am allowed to share the company's name here, but I will say it is a reputable jewelry company based out of California.

I needed the original order number for my engagement ring as well as photos so the company could make sure the band would match correctly. I noticed the sales invoice had the \\*correct\\* diamond type listed, yet the diamond we received is \\*different\\*. After a few back-and-forth emails and phone calls, the customer service rep verified that the diamond I received was not the same as the diamond we ordered. The certification pamphlet I received with the ring matches the stone, and the certification code on the invoice matches the pamphlet, but the sales invoice diamond type does not match the stone and pamphlet.  This is a blip from the email from the customer service rep:  \"About  your center stone, I did get the full context, it was a misspelling on  cut type on the website, however the certification and everything else  about the stone was correct, which is good, I was afraid a bigger issue  had taken place.

He was asking for it back. He said that it was delivered on 22 June. He also brought the local police, but the officer stayed in his car and didn't approach us. I told the man that we did not have his package and had not seen it (this is true). He was five feet into my yard when he told me that he was filming us, which was too much for me, so I calmly told him to leave and not come back. He left in short order. The whole engagement was less than two minutes. After he left we talked to the police officer, and I volunteered my info and told him that we were out of town on 22 June and when we returned on 24 June we did not have the alleged package waiting for us.

We haven't had a single package stolen from our porch since we moved in seven months ago, and when we returned from our trip on 24 June a giant Amazon box (dog food) was waiting on our front porch, so the chances that a package was accidentally delivered to us and then stolen in the three days that we were gone seem very small.

On December 14th, 2021, I was coming up over a hill, and as I got to the top of the hill, a line of cars were braking suddenly… and I rear ended someone. I didn’t have enough time to stop due to not being able to see the brake lights as I was approaching/coming up over the hill.   I asked the guy if he was ok and apologized at least a million times. He said yes, and when the police asked if he needed medical assistance, he said no. He did mention to me that he has had back surgery before. The guy in front of the guy I rear ended also pulled over and told the police that he witnessed me coming over the hill and told them I didn’t have enough time to brake.

You are being sued, because your insurance company is refusing to pay the settlement to the allegedly injured party in an amount that they are willing to accept.

My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was \"acting like a slut\" and \"dressing inappropriately\" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent \"promiscuity\". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because \"[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.\"  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a \"you're starting high school\" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again.

It has now come out that the person they bought it from wasn't the owner, her cousin was the owner and he forged a quit claim deed and had her evicted by the police. He then turned around and sold it to my brother and his wife.  They had no idea. They thought the sale was legitimate. They had a real estate agent and got the mortgage from the bank.

It sucks, but title insurance will help them settle this.   I feel like there is more to the story than this anyway. If the cousin took this to court to file an eviction, than the court has likely seen the title and found that it was valid. Be very careful that this isn't a scam itself happening."

Iv contacted my property manager several times about this issue and at first he would come out and have them move their car. Recently the project manager just says they’ll take care of it so they can’t park there anymore but my neighbor keeps parking there. Fed up with how it was being handled I told my manager if it happens again I’ll call the tow truck myself. They responded saying they would take care of it and make sure it doesn’t happens again. 4 days later and same thing happened so I called the tow truck. During the tow my neighbor came out and paid the driver to lower their car. They then ripped the fire lane sign off my wall which I believe is illegal? A week later I got a letter in my mail box from the neighbor demanding I pay the amount they spent to lower their car ($50) or they will take me to small claims. I took a picture of the car parked in front of the sign before they ripped the sign off and texts to and from my manager about the situation as proof that this wasn’t a one time thing.

He's been dumping his trailer and other stuff over her property line for years, despite her asking him to keep off her property.  She had the land surveyed a few years ago so she knows he is on her property.  Last year she put up wooden stakes with rope along the property line and jerk neighbour pulls them out of the ground and throws them onto her property.  She's in her 80's and lives alone.  Bylaw has been called after that incident and they spoke with the neighbour but things have only gotten worse.    The neighbour has been digging during the night, a septic tank hole which is deep and about 20 feet into her property.  My husband went out with a professional surveyor today to find out where exactly the property lines are and now it is clearly marked, with this big hole in Grandma's yard.  We already have someone lined up to fill in the hole but we are concerned about the liability issue since it's on her property.    We are building a fence in the coming weeks along the property line.  When he first started digging, Grandma decided it was time to build a fence to hopefully end this.  What we didn't know before the surveyor came out was why he was digging this hole - there's pipes in it and it is for a septic bed.  We assume he had no permits since he did it during the nights and not during the day so my Grandma is going to Town Hall to speak with someone there about this.  Is there anything else she should be doing though? I think they are giving the neighbour notice to get his pipes out ASAP as we are filling in the hole this week - do we even need to tell him?

Tomorrow I'm going to talk to the parents of the other little girl and I just want to prepare myself and know if there is anything I can do at all if it doesn't go well.  I have legal custody of my 8 year old niece. Her parents are not involved at all, except for the child support her father pays. I've had her for three years now. About a month ago, my niece stole my most expensive piece of jewelry-- a white gold and diamond ring that my husband had purchased for me as an anniversary gift. Niece claimed she'd dropped it out of the school bus window, and I wrote it off as a very expensive parenting lesson. However, over the course of the last month, a whole bunch of things started to point to her not having dropped it out of the bus window after all but, rather, having given it to a friend that she has been over eager to please.  The final straw came this week when she tried to steal another (much less valuable) piece of jewelry of mine and lied to my husband, saying it belonged to this girl. I took away her ipad and told her she wasn't getting it back until I got my ring back, and for the first time, instead of arguing with me, she just said \"okay\". Through a fairly complicated series of events that she is not aware that I know, she inadvertently revealed (in plain, written english) that she did, in fact, give my ring to this girl to try to bribe her to be friends with her (which is another issue entirely that we're working on in therapy-- not why I'm here).  My mother in law happens to know my niece's classmate's mom, and tomorrow we'll be going to the house to explain the situation and ask for the ring back. But, aside from asking nicely, is there anything else we can do? I'm assuming we're just relying on this family's good will to give my ring back at this point, right?  Any advice would be welcome.  Thank you.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Since all the advice here is to call the police I'll give you a different civil option.  The ring is your property and your niece made an illegal transfer of your property claiming to have title when she didn't.  That doesn't make the transfer valid and the friend doesn't magically have a valid title to the ring because the niece gave it to her.  Having a conversation seeking the return of the ring with the friend's parents is the best course of action.    If they refuse, you can take the parents to court for the return of the ring on the theory that their daughter does not have proper title and that you are the true owner wanting your property back."

He didn’t pay anything. His name was never on anything. Not the title, not the insurance, not the mortgage, not even the utilities.   We did have an unwritten agreement that he’d pay half the mortgage, utilities, and other shared expenses like groceries. And for about a year, maybe, he did pay me varying amounts of money. It was never half, and it caused a lot of arguments. Whatever he paid me, he paid in cash. Since summer 2011 I have paid all of it. He pays for whatever food he eats outside of groceries and covers whatever expenses he has. I don’t know anything about that. He runs “businesses” that include a youtube channel, a Twitch channel, and he’s in a band. I don’t have any idea how much money he made at them, or if he made any at all.

I told him I was planning to move out of state without him and that he needed to leave the house. I told him to be out by mid July.   He totally ignored me and did nothing. July came and went. I moved out of state. He stayed in my house.

So far here's what's been dug up.  I sold my land to Developer A. He owned the land for about 2 years and then filed bankruptcy and lost the land to the bank. That's when the maintenance of the land went to shit and I was mowing it and taking care of it, cause the bank didn't care. Bank sold it to Developer B and that is the person that built the current neighborhood. We got in touch with Developer B and he said he was no longer part of the neighborhood and in fact, the HOA is in charge of the entire area. His company just owned the lots and they sold/built on them for the families and they have 0 say anymore. I asked him about the master plans and if he thought he owned my remaining 10 acres, and he said absolutely not. The entire neighborhood sits on old land + the 20 acres that were purchased from in. So he was helpful and it was clear he had no wrongdoing.  I spoke to the lawyer to see if we could file and adverse possession on the land I maintained but he said it would be a waste of time and money, but I was just going to do it to spite the HOA. The title search and everything came up clean. It showed my parents as the previous owners and then me. So no way could they have owned my land. The records go way back, and there is a clear chain of ownership as my lawyer put it and it's incontestable.  We sent a HOA a cease and desist letter as well to stop contacting me unless they have actual signed documents that show I was part of a HOA. They never got back to me. I was out of town on came back last night to my mailbox missing. It was cut clear off the post with a chainsaw (wooden post with a metal mailbox on top). I told my lawyer this and he says that it is a big deal and that USPS would send the person to jail? I repurchased an identical mailbox and set up cameras all over the property. If they try it again, I'll have them on tape.  But the biggest thing we uncovered was that we found out what they are planning. Turns out that the HOA wants to put in ANOTHER community playground and a pool/clubhouse and they need land! They can't expand in any other direction since they're almost on the end of a highway on 1 side and the other sides are zoned for agriculture, they decided they'd try to take over my land. They have yet to also file a lien on my property so I'm guessing they were trying to force me into the HOA to make them sell my land below market value?  Either way, they showed their hand and now I'm on alert. We filed a complaint with the police regarding the stolen mailbox and we have a paper trail for that now.

The US Post Office Postal Inspectors take mail boxes very seriously.  Many years ago we lived on an island in the Seattle area.  There was a family down on the waterfront that rented a house up the hill from us for their sons to get them out of the house.  They blew up the neighbor's mail box with a cherry bomb a couple of times.  A week later we woke up at 5am with the Postal Inspectors raiding the house (with heavy weapons) and hauling the kids out of their beds and spread eagled them in their underwear out on the frosty front lawn.  You would think that they just busted Al Capone.  > It's just a waiting game to see what they do next I guess. Should I ......  Personally, I would just do absolutely nothing - just being as quiet as possible.  Let them think that you have just forgotten about the whole thing.  Just let them do whatever they are going to do.  * Touching your mailbox again especially on camera would be a Federal felony.  The Postal Inspectors would love that.  * Filing a false lien on your property would be a State felony.  Plus most states have additional laws on the books letting you go after the perpetrators civilly.  I would have to think that your lawyer would love doing this.  * Whom ever is acting - appears to be acting on behalf of the HOA which would be a lucrative target for you.  Trying to make you believe that you are subordinate to the HOA's rules and fines, etc., I am sure that they will come up with something to apply to you - perhaps towing your car parked in your driveway.  That would be a local felony - grand theft auto."

So in my junior year of high school my parents discovered that I had a fetish they didn't like so they sent me to a pricey widely known therapist to try to cure me. I was forced to see him once a week for about 2 years.   One day I missed an appointment because I was running late and my train was severely delayed. That day he told me he would be charging me the 150 dollars an hour that my parents were supposed to be paying because \"he's helping me act like more of an adult\". Over the course of 2 years I missed 4 appointments. Sometimes because of sports, sometimes because There was a miscommunication in scheduling. I never once blatantly blew off an appointment for the hell of it. Well Now I'm a freshman in college (So poor) and He keeps sending me invoices for the 600$ that I owe him.   I'm a fucking kid. If I knew for a second that I would ever have to pay for my own therapy sessions, I wouldn't go to an expensive therapist! But I didn't have a choice. I never signed anything, and he never told me about this policy of his until I missed an appointment.   The worst part is that recently he has been informing me that because I have not been paying up, that he is going to charge me 20$ a month interest until I pay everything off.   So do I HAVE to pay this guy? Does he get to decide who owes him money and who doesn't? I don't even have 600$ to my name and this 20$ interest he pulled out of his ass isn't going to help.

Now, if you were a minor at the time and you requested these services without telling your parents, then they would not be responsible for paying the costs.

I'm still very shaken up as my roommate was also a very close friend of mine so I'm not sure how to word things but here is a list of more information:  The suicide happened inside the apartment (thankfully I was not home at the time and the authorities handled everything)  Their family and I have already removed all of their belongings  They co-signed on the lease with me in August  I had been living there for 1 year prior with a different roommate (moved across the country)  Continuing to live there is not an option for me after what happened. I can't mentally handle the idea of it and can barely go in there by myself at all since it happened.  I can't afford the rent by myself  I have emailed the front office and have been communicating with them on a good time to meet. I just wanted some advice prior to that about next-steps because I've never even had a lease before, much less know where to begin in terms of breaking one.  Any advice at all is appreciated\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I am sorry to hear of your loss.  Wisconsin actually addresses the death of a tenant in statute, Wisc. §704.165.  If you and/or his family provide notice to the landlord of his death, your roommate's tenancy can end in 60 days, so his estate's obligations to pay rent end too.   They don't need a certified death certificate;  the law just requires that the landlord *know* the tenant is dead.  But the same statute doesn't give you the ability to end your obligations under the lease:  it specifically says in subsection 3:  >Nothing in this section relieves another adult tenant of the deceased tenant's premises from any obligation under a rental agreement or any other liability to the landlord.  So your options are to negotiate with your landlord, or force their hand.  They may decide to let you out of the lease.   They might agree to do so for the equivalent of one month's rent.  Or they might be hard-asses and offer nothing.  Wisconsin, like most other states, obligates a landlord to \"mitigate their damages\" by re-renting the apartment if you break the lease and move out.   That obligation is written into landlord-tenant law (Wisc. §704.29) instead of being a common-law tradition.  I don't know what the housing market is like in Madison in November;  if this is desirable student housing there might be some demand that builds up at the new semester."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [NJ] Downstairs neighbor towed my car I just recently moved into a new apartment and have a lease agreement with my landlord stating that I have access to a parking spot in front of the house. After my first day of living there my car was towed by my downstairs neighbor who doesn’t have the same parking agreement. I spent ~$300 on getting my car back and the ticket police gave me. I called my landlord about this and he said that the neighbor certainly does not have parking access and has no say over who parks there. However, the neighbor told the cops that the parking spot was hers and that was being blocked my car.  Towing company is familiar with the neighbor and have told me she’s a problematic person to deal with. Their advice was to file a complaint against her to the police for falsifying a claim for getting my car towed. So what are my options here?  I told the landlord about this and he said he would cover $100 from the charges but obviously that’s not enough. If I have to take one of them to court, who would it be? The neighbor for falsely claiming to own the parking spot or my landlord who broke his lease agreement.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Judging by your comment replies elsewhere, it sounds like you're misrepresenting (perhaps unintentionally) what actually went on.  1) You have a parking spot allotted by your lease.  However, I am willing to bet it is the driveway which you are opting not to use.  Instead you are using street parking which your landlord has no control over (not that any of this would be his problem anyway).  2) Police rarely, if ever, are going to come out because someone parked in someone else's parking space.  That's a civil matter either between renters or between a renter and a landlord.  I am willing to bet your neighbor reported you for blocking a driveway, not anything about being in her spot.  Therefore, it was not a false claim or report.  Hence why you were ticketed.  Bottom line, you probably don't have anyone to sue.  Thank your lucky stars your landlord is being needlessly generous.  Make sure you park legally next time, because no doubt your neighbor *will* keep you honest.  If you want to make peace with the neighbor, I would suggest using the driveway which you are paying for in your rent, and leave the public street parking for her."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [California] Will a court grant a restraining order against people who haven't been violent? The background to my story is someone ruined my cousin's life and drove her to suicide. My cousin was given guardianship of her friend's son after her friend and her husband died. This person planted drugs in the car and garage and called the police and CPS about it and she was charged and child was taken into foster care, did something to the deed of her condo and it was stolen from her and sold, lied about things she did at work to her fired, hacked into her computer and planted disgusting porn involving children and alerted the police about that, impersonated her at the bank and stole all her money and hit my cousin with a motorcycle leaving her badly injured. After all of this my cousin committed suicide. Months after this the actions started to come unraveled when footage from a camera showed the bike speeding away (with a plate registered to the person) and the person was caught receiving a tax return in my cousins name.  Everything came out eventually. This person was arrested and jailed for everything she did to my cousin and for other crimes related to marijuana and obstructing justice. I have done my best to move on. This was over a decade ago. The person's parents have begun to do to me what I believe is harassment. Same to other members of my family, including my 90 year old grandmother who is in a retirement home. The person who hurt my cousin has cancer. Her parents want us to forgive her before she dies. They have come to my house in person 9 times, sent me 15 letters, had 2 different lawyers send me letters asking me to meet with this person in jail while she is still \"well\". I have had over 30 phone calls from them, I have been visited by someone claiming to be a minister and also received a letter from him telling me to forgive and one of her parents has come to my job 3 times. They visited my 90 year old grandmother 4 times before we made it with the home that they have to stay away. They have also went to see my teenage niece at the bus stop outside of her school (she was just a baby when this happened) and visited my brother over a dozen time at his job and sent him a bunch of letters. They stood in front of my aunt and uncles car and blocked them in their driveway and only left when my aunt started dialing the police.  We want them to leave us alone. I don't care if their daughter has cancer and none of us want to meet or forgive her. Her parents have not been violent or threatening but my family has been through enough. If we got a lawyer and tried to get a restraining order in court would the court even bother with something like this? The prosecutor back then during this person's trial was great to our family but he has long since retired so we can't ask him what we should do. We have copies of the letters, phone records and security video from mine and my brother's place of work to help prove our case.

About a week ago i received a summons to appear in court as a witness to an incident where i was assaulted by a customer. The law suit seems to be between my previous employer and the person who assaulted me.  In may 2020 I was working as a greeter at a retail store in TX, i told someone they were required to put a mask on, person refused, I asked them to leave, the person slapped/pushed me, and had a meltdown. I never touched the customer, and immediately retreated. A customer called police. I never went to the ER or anything. Woman was arrested, I gave my statement to the cops. Never heard anything about it from the police again.  My employer was really pissed off and a week later I was sacked for failing to follow procedures in handling this customer after review. I don't know what procedures, but I was pissed off. But I was already planning to give notice so I just made a vow to never shop there again.  Anyways my problems:  * I am supposed to appear in a few weeks in a court in Texas, I live in NY. We are living on a shoe string budget. * This law firm who sent the summons spent a week ignoring me.

We went into a conference room, the HR lady was there, and they promptly told me that they were terminating my employment. They said that it had nothing to do with my performance, and gave me no other indication for a reason as to why they were firing me with no notice except that it was a \"difficult business decision.\" They provided me with a separation agreement that I have in my possession but did not sign.  I know that Colorado is an at-will state so that on the surface all that is legal. What complicates this is that I am pregnant. I had recently notified my direct boss that I was pregnant so that he could be aware of and approve me being out for some doctor's appointment. Apart from that, I told no other leadership or HR.  My question is, how involved does my direct boss need to be in the decision to fire me? My impression is that he was not informed of the decision until the day/moment I was fired. He knew I was pregnant and I believe would have brought up that information if he had been involved in the decision, even if just as a CYA measure.

We never charged her any rent because I wanted her to save her money to move out, and it was supposed to be only two weeks. She has now been here for 21 weeks.   I am due to have my baby in 3 weeks. Really it could be any day now since I'm already having contractions sporadically. I have tried everything to get her to leave. I have bluntly told her what day she needed to move out, even offered to give her money for first and last months rent with no expectation of being paid back. Still nothing. She's a squatter at this point. If I try to talk to her about leaving she cries and says I'm being mean.  Finally last night when I had a contraction, I told her there were 3 women's shelters in the area that she can go to, but she's done here. I told her to be out by the 15th, which is when my next doctor's appointment is, and that I'll give her a ride and help her pack her things if she needs it.
