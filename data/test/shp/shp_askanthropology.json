Given that anthropology is based on extensive qualitative observation, often without a clear focus initially, how do anthropologists deal with what must be an overwhelming pile of notes? In quant research, you can start by graphing things and finding summary statistics. But presumably in anthropology you just have pile of text, images, and recordings.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I tend to make \"themes\". So say I have two months of fieldwork notes (although I would highly advise that you compile and integrate notes during fieldwork), I would sit down, or pace, with them. Putting them in little piles where the topic is somewhat related. Repeat process when new text is produced from the notes.  It's of course dependent on what theoretical frame you are using, epistemological justifications etc. But say in a grounded theory approach if you just try to make sense of all the data, I find this to be a pragmatic way of doing it. Sort of like the corkboard in old detective movies.  Doing this while doing fieldwork will often result in better fieldwork as certain themes emerge that might be fruitful to pursue, and thus knowing what to ask/observe and so forth."

    "golden_answer": " The recently released *The Dawn of Everything* by the late anthropologist David Graeber and the archaeologist David Wengrow discusses a whole host of different issues in human pre-history and early history, many of which aren't directly related to this question. But in chapters 6 through 8 they discuss the origins of things like agriculture, cities, temples, literacy, etc.  Note that though these phenomena were related to one another, their relationships were complex and varied from one place and time to another. There wasn't a single \"revolution\" in which agriculture, monumental architecture, cities, states, organized religion, writing, all arose at once. Nor was there a single, linear course of history, as societies often abandoned agriculture or cities to shift to other social structures and subsistence strategies.  The beginnings of agriculture began after the last ice age receded 12,000 years ago (the beginning of the Holocene). Before the, according to Graeber and Wengrow, there was rarely a climate warm enough for growing crops to be an effective subsistence strategy in comparison to the others available - and even then it wasn't always very successful.   But there is a range of several thousands of years between the first experiments in farming in places like Middle-Eastern river valleys and those of different regions and continents. So they weren't all that simultaneous.   These first developments were not fully agricultural societies; people grew food but also hunted, gathered, and fished, and the process of domestication was drawn out over thousands of years, slower than it would have been if they had chosen to dedicate themselves entirely to the domestication of crops.  But there is some more simultaneity to the development of large sedentary, urban societies - not synonymous with, but enabling the possibility of things like writing and bureaucracy. And Graeber and Wengrow attribute that to the beginnings of particular climatic/ecological conditions around 7,000 years ago:  >Ecological factors often played a role in the formation of cities, but in this particular case these would appear to be only obliquely related to the intensification of agriculture. Still, there are hints of a pattern. Across many parts of Eurasia, and in a few parts of the Americas, the appearance of cities follows quite closely on a secondary, post-Ice Age shuffling of the ecological pack which started around 5000 BC. At least two environmental changes were at work here.   >   >The first concerns rivers. At the beginning of the Holocene, the world’s great rivers were mostly still wild and unpredictable. Then, around 7,000 years ago, flood regimes started changing, giving way to more settled routines. This is what created wide and highly fertile floodplains along the Yellow River, the Indus, the Tigris and other rivers that we associate with the first urban civilizations. Parallel to this, the melting of polar glaciers slowed down in the Middle Holocene to a point that allowed sea levels the world over to stabilize, at least to a greater degree than they ever had before. The combined effect of these two processes was dramatic; especially where great rivers met the open waters, depositing their seasonal loads of fertile silt faster than seawaters could push them back. This was the origin of those great fan-like deltas we see today at the head of the Mississippi, the Nile or the Euphrates, for instance.   >   >Comprising well-watered soils, annually sifted by river action, and rich wetland and waterside habitats favoured by migratory game and waterfowl, such deltaic environments were major attractors for human populations. Neolithic farmers gravitated to them, along with their crops and livestock. Hardly surprising, considering these were effectively scaled-up versions of the kind of river, spring and lakeside environments in which Neolithic horticulture first began, but with one other major difference: just over the horizon lay the open sea, and before it expansive marshlands supplying aquatic resources to buffer the risks of farming, as well as a perennial source of organic materials (reeds, fibres, silt) to support construction and manufacturing.   >   >All this, combined with the fertility of alluvial soils further inland, promoted the growth of more specialized forms of farming in Eurasia, including the use of animal-drawn ploughs (also adopted in Egypt by 3000 BC), and the breeding of sheep for wool. Extensive agriculture may thus have been an outcome, not a cause, of urbanization."

I'm trying to understand why many humans would have switched to agriculture as opposed to being hunter-gatherers.  Isn't it far less effort to hunt animals and forage than to spend ages waiting for crops to grow, enduring bad harvests, blight, exhausted soil, etc?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " An all-comprehensive response is very difficult, not only because the way in which agriculture arose and spread was highly varied, but also because there is considerable scientific investigation and debate going on regarding the specificities. \r   But I try to give you a short summary of the most important points, based mainly on Scarre, C. (2017). The Human Past: World History & the Development of Human Societies (Fourth ed.). Thames & Hudson.\r   Agriculture can appear in any given region in two main ways: either by indigenous innovation/development or by an introduction from the outside. \r   We know of at least 7 regions of the world, that agricultural practices developed independently (Southwest Asia, East Asia, New Guinea, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean South America, Central Mexico, and the eastern US). But what their agriculture entailed and how it developed, and how it subsequently spread varied widely. \r   Before I dive into the possible reasons for agricultural change, I would like to emphasize, that the adoption of agriculture in the “innovator societies” was gradual. We have evidence that overwhelmingly hunter-gatherer/forager groups increasingly started to make use of predictable food resources (such as plants that are abundant during certain times and places, or animal herds that migrate through certain regions at certain times), they increasingly started to manage these resources, and eventually domesticate them and focus their subsistence strategies on these. This, at least in the cases of societies relying on plant-based agriculture, usually led to permanent settlement, but the change seems to be gradual in this too. So, just to use a simple, but conceivable example, it’s possible that a group of humans realized that there is an area where fruit grows abundantly in certain parts of the year, thus they started to visit this area each year to exploit it. They carry some of the fruit with them and probably dispose of the seeds around their temporary camps. As they visited these sites again, they might have realized that new trees grew from the “planted” seeds, thus they might have started to intentionally plant trees at other locations they visited. As the number of these predictable resources increased, humans might have been keener on relying on them, making a loop, in which engagement with agriculture resulted in even more reliance on agriculture and even more incentive to engage with it. \r   Now let’s consider the reasons why people started to be engaged with agriculture, and why only after thousands of years of the existence of physiologically modern humans. One important reason that had been argued is that the climate of most regions of the world was widely unpredictable before the last Ice Age (c. 11,500 years ago), which didn’t leave much place for agriculture. But after that, the climate slowly stabilized and resulted in today’s climate around much of the world. The modern climate stabilized only around 7,000 years ago (5000 BCE) in many regions. An illustrative example is that it was only 8,500 years ago, that in Asia, Malaysia separated from Sumatra, and in Europe, Britain separated from mainland Europe. So, the climate stabilized between 11,500-7,000 years ago, and probably it's not surprising that it’s around that time, that we have started to have the earliest evidence for agriculture. \r   Another reason proposed is that people were “forced” to adopt more productive subsistence strategies because resources declined due to extensive (and increasing) human exploitation. It is argued that after the end of the last Ice Age, resources became much more abundant, and humans quickly exploited this, which led to significant population growth, especially in resource-rich areas. It’s probably not surprising, that lot of people frequented the green corridor along the Nile valley, which was so much more resourceful than the area around it (even when we consider that parts of the Sahara were more like a Savanna and habitable back then). So as a consequence, human groups started to be confined to smaller areas, where intentional managing of the food resources was necessary to survive in a now less resource-rich environment with more people around. \r   I also have to note that these early groups show remarkable versatility in how they adapted to changing environments (but of course, we have survival bias here). The first “agriculturalists” engaged with a wide variety of plants and animals. Some of the groups that we know of eventually started to depend more and more on staple cereals (such as wheat, millet, rice, barley, corn), tubers, or other fruits and vegetables, many also made extensive use of animals. Dogs are the earliest examples, but we have also very early examples of not just fishing, but also creating structures for exploiting water-based resources. Pastoralism and other forms of husbandry were also present from an early time, and these again were gradually incorporated into the strategies of the groups. This, opposed in most cases to plant-based agriculture, did not require settlement of the groups. We also have evidence, that certain groups changed their strategies according to the changes in their environment, thus a different mix of hunting, gathering, foraging, animal, and plant management strategies were used as times required. Some societies even went back to being hunter/gatherers after an agricultural phase. \r   Now, as for the dispersal of agriculture. Whereas in some places, agriculture was “indigenous”, in other places, it was introduced from the outside. This had two main channels. One is that the neighbors and trade partners of already agriculturalist groups borrowed the invention in a peaceful way and on a voluntary basis. This certainly happened. But it seems that more frequently, agriculture was spread by the dispersal of agriculturalist populations, who either displaced former local (hunter/gatherer) populations or assimilated them. It seems very likely, that a mixture of these forces was at play at most places since foreign influences might have influenced the adoption of certain elements of agriculture, while also influencing local domestication of indigenous species."

An example of this is among Arctic dwelling peoples, whose skin is significantly darker than most modern Northern Europeans.  Perhaps Western Hunter-Gatherers had a much higher dietary intake of vitamin D through higher access to rivers and coastal areas (and hence fish) than Hunter-Gatherers living in the comparatively more arid Middle-East. In this case, even if the genes for lighter skin were present in Western Hunter-Gatherers, vitamin D intake was high enough through diet that there wasn't a strong enough selection pressure to cause large amounts of the population to develop lighter skin over time, whereas in the Middle-East where protein intake was based more on terrestrial hunting and lower dietary vitamin D intake did."

But, I'm no expert so I thought maybe someone smarter would make this hypothesis more palatable.  Or, failing that, give me more specific reasons to dismiss it as nonsense. Maybe even tell me how it became a mainstream (ish) hypothesis to begin with.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " EDIT: So to quick explain AAH, its the theory that the major cause for a ton of our adaptations is that humans were  aquatic apes who became bipedal primarily because of wading into deep water. Depending on who you talk to they will quote different traits, but mainly its hairlessness, diving reflex, webbed fingers, hooded noses etc.  So AAH is a fun hypothesis to throw around at students to make them think, but it also falls short in many many ways and really falls short of pretty much any scrutiny. Water has definitely been a part of human evolution, but nowhere near the level that AAH implies. I'll try and hit a few of the major points of AAH, but if you have any questions please ask.  Point 1: Our relative hairlessness  The thing is that that can more easily be explained by our bipedalism and running abilities. Hair reduces the cooling ability of an animal and our bipedalism is a specialized adaptation to a hot climate. On top of that looking at the biological adaptations we have that deal with bipedalism would have made us worse aquatic animals (we are tall and thin, aquatic animals are short and stout, it deals with heat dissipation and surface area).   On top of that most semi aquatic mammals have a lot of fur. In fact they tend to have the densest, and finest fur of all mammals. The only real exception is Hippos and that deals in their body shape and hydrodynamics (Hippos bones are super dense, and make them sink making fur and air bubbles less likely to help them at any depth, so they compensate with blubber instead of heavy fur though they do still have some fur).   On top of that if you look at semi aquatic mammals they don't have long limbs, that's worse for swimming, and is a horrible adaptation to submersion since it cools the blood in said limbs.   Basically our adaptations are not good for water, but they are great for standing upright in a sunny area.    Point 2: diving reflex, human infants hold their breath automatically when submerged and our heart rate decreased autonomously when our face is wet.  So all mammals that have a womb are born with diving instinct (ironically platypus are the only one that aren't and they are aquatic). Basically its the same feeling as being in the womb so they don't try and breath. It actually disappears quite quickly in humans too. From there any swimming movements should be more seen as an attempt to find traction for movement, not actual swimming.  Point 3: our hooded noses (which prevent water from going into our lungs when upright under water).  So primates can be split into two groups catarrhine (old world monkeys); and Platyrrhini (New world monkeys). All old world monkeys have noses that face down and hooded nostrils. The question of how far down they face is dependent on how defined their nose is from their snout. In humans that deals primarily with the reduction of the honing canine, but all great apes have hooded nostrils.  Point 4: minor webbing of our fingers  We have no more or less \"webbing\" than any of the other great apes.  Point 5: Prune finger reflex (which increases grip underwater)  Well a few things. First off all primates fingers prune up when exposed to water long term. Second it doesn't REALLY increase grip underwater. Every study done doesn't show any real advantage by comparison of pruney fingers to non pruney fingers in dexterity, feeling, or grip. Truth is we aren't exactly sure why they prune up, that's just an explanation that got proposed in 2011 and has kinda stuck in pop science explanations.  AAH is fun to think about, and humans absolutely swam and used aquatic resources earlier than we think about. But it was most likely not a driving force behind our evolutionary traits."

    "golden_answer": " It's a mixture of true (but not novel), false, and misleading claims. What they call \"the standard narrative\" is not really an academic consensus, which can be seen by how much they cite anthropologists in arguments against other anthropologists. It can be found in some of the literature, but it is far more influential in pop science than primary literature. If they had said that, it probably would have provoked less of a response, but instead they went with the idea that they were overturning some kind of \"establishment\" consensus and instituting a new scientific paradigm, because many of the \"standard narrative\" ideas they want to debunk have already been debunked within the field. So it's nothing new.  Second, any hypothesis that tells you that there was one single pattern that held across the entirety of pre-Neolithic humanity is pretty safe to dismiss. There is an amazing amount of diversity among contemporary hunter-gatherers with respect to all sorts of variables and cultural phenomena and there's no reason to suppose that didn't hold true in the stone ages.

    "golden_answer": " To address this question, it's important to understand first of all that there have been all kinds of marriages in human history -- between any combination of genders. Marriage is about many things -- managing/controlling labor, managing property, procreation, sexuality, companionship, love, authority, alliance, etc. Whether marriage itself is considered \"sacred\" really depends on cultural/historical context, as well as how you define both \"marriage\" and \"sacred\" -- definitions that are by no means universally agreed upon.  A few things will help you clarify your question:  - Neither sex nor romantic love are exclusive to heterosexual pairings. Nor is marriage (although marriage has been reserved for heterosexual pairings in certain contexts at various points in time)  - Most marriage in human history has been more about property, labor and power than love or sex, though these things can be tangled together in messy ways  - Friendship is not always between people of the same gender.  To answer your question with all that in mind, yes. Again, depending on how you define \"sacred\", there are many institutions that might fit this description.  Consider institutions of \"blood brothers\" in many cultures including many European ones. Or for a more specific example, you might think about woman-woman marriages in East Africa, which researchers have argued are about a variety of things including emotional bonds as well as \"practical\" matters of reproduction, household labor, property, social status, etc. (e.g. see this work by Njambi & O'Brien).  Friendship is understudied in anthropology though there are a couple of edited volumes, one edited by Bell and Coleman, and another edited by Desai and Killick, which might be of interest. Desai's chapter in the latter is about \"ritual friendship\" in India which seems like the kind of institution you're interested in."

The disappearance of P-Celtic languages in England (except Cornwall) happened a *much* longer time ago than the forced decline of Welsh in Wales. We know very little about the mechanism by which the Celtic languages of England disappeared, but there seems to have been significant ethnic replacement by speakers of Old English. This may have been hastened by the fact that many people in Roman Britain might have been speaking a Latin vernacular rather than a Celtic language by the time the English arrived.

    "golden_answer": " >What social/cultural/political developments led to homophobia in Russia?  &#x200B;  Nothing \"led to\" it.  Russian cultural attitudes towards sexuality are more or less what they've always been.  The Western world has changed a lot in its attitude towards homosexuality, sexuality and gender- Russia not so much.  So the \"origins of\" - really lie as much in  the West as in Russia. North Americans had similar attitudes towards, say, same sex marriage as Russia does - in 1990. Our ideas changed, theirs not so much. Russia has always had a very ambivalent relationship with ideas from the West -sometimes embracing them, only to become less enthusiastic and then to repudiate them.  There was some impulse towards \"erotic glasnost\" in the 1990s, but didn't get that far.   Russia retains some aspects of Soviet era health and morality policies - abortion and divorce were part of the secularization that followed the Bolshevik revolution, and have substantially \"stuck\" in the culture. Homosexuality, though, while decriminalized after 1920, was substantially suppressed by Stalin.  You might compare with Poland - politically aligned against Putin's Russia, but culturally the Law & Society Party have very similar views about gender and sexuality. Indeed, Russia is notable in still basically allowing abortion up to 12 weeks, while its been essentially abolished in Poland.  See  * Costlow, Jane T., Stephanie Sandler, and Judith Vowles, eds.

    "golden_answer": " I have a Ph.D. in anthropology and work as an archaeologist. Your question is difficult to answer briefly given how complex and broad the field of anthropology is.  In the US, there are four primary subfields of anthropology including archaeology (study of past material cultural), cultural anthro (study of cultural variation), biological anth (biological aspects of humans), and linguistics (study of language from an anthropological viewpoint). Each of these subfields include an untold amount of vastly different subjects to specialize in. For example, one archaeologist may study the origins of agriculture in Asia while another focuses on what life was like for immigrant women during the 19th century gold rush. Figuring out what you want to study is one of the fun parts of school and I suggest taking as many different courses as you can during undergraduate studies (also consider courses in the Classics if you enjoy ancient Greece/Rome stuff).  As far as what a career in anthropology is like, I can only speak to archaeology. Importantly though, if you plan on pursuing a career in anthropology be prepared to attend graduate school. Most subfields require a Master's degree or, in many cases, a Ph.D. to land a full-time research oriented position. That isn't to say you cannot put an anthro degree to good use in other career fields. However, if you want to do research (especially on what you're interested in) you will likely need a Ph.D. and to pursue a job at an academic institution (college or museum). Now archaeology is a little different from the other subfields because federal laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act require cultural resources (artifacts and archaeological sites) to be protected on federal and state lands. Because of this, federal and state agencies employ many archaeologists to manage cultural resources on government lands. However, most archaeologists in the US actually work for private cultural resource management firms (at the BA, MA, and PhD level). These companies are often contracted by the government  to ensure various gov. projects (building roads, bases, etc...) are in compliance with cultural resource laws. For example, if the government wanted to build a road across federal lands they would need archaeologists to come in and determine if the work was going to negatively impact important cultural resources. Such projects would minimally include surveying (and sometimes excavating) the building area, recording any sites found, and writing a report detailing your findings and recommendations. Depending on your company/client, you may even get to conduct more advanced analysis/research on your findings and publish them in academic journals. While plenty of archaeologists work for universities, museums, and federal agencies, the vast majority work in cultural resource management (CRM) and there are well paying careers to be had in that area of work. Unfortunately, academic positions are few and far between and often pay less than senior level CRM positions but they can be very rewarding if you are willing to put in the work to obtain one.  I know this was pretty broad but please feel free to ask follow up questions if you want more information."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Could someone explain to me the difference between Assyrians and Arameans,and the nuances of Assyrian and Aramean identity if possible?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I know this answer is a bit late, but I've done a fair bit of reading on the genetics and identity of modern Assyrians (and Arameans), so I would be very happy to share with you what I have found. It's a very complicated issue, so I will try to cover all core information.  First of all, the modern people who call themselves Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, and Aramean all belong to the same ethnoreligious group, sometimes called \"Syriac-speaking Christians,\" since they speak dialects of Neo-Aramaic, a modern form of Syriac. What really differentiates them from each other is church denomination. Assyrians belong to the Assyrian Church of the East, also known as the \"Nestorian\" Church. This is the oldest church of the three that Syriac Christians belong to. Chaldeans belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church that split off from the original Church of the East in 1551CE. Arameans and Syriacs belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the \"Jacobite\" Church. Yet, they are all the same people, and the most commonly accepted label is the Assyrian one.  The conflict between the people who identify and Assyrian and the people who identify as Aramean has severely divided this community. \"Arameans\" are almost always members of the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, \"Assyrians\" are found in all three churches, though, of course, they have the strongest presence in the Assyrian Church of the East. Modern Arameans believe that they descend from the ancient Arameans, a tribal people who likely originated from the Syrian desert in southern Syria. Modern Assyrians believe that they descend from the Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Mesopotamia. This has caused an intense debate on the true origins and identity of the modern Assyrians. Personally, I have found the Assyrian side of the argument to be significantly better supported, via historical accounts, genetics, linguistics, and geographical location. However, there are scholars that support either side of the argument."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Multilingualism and monolingualism as cultures? I got into an argument recently that suggested to my mind that multilingualism and monolingualism may be cultures or have cultures surrounding them that produce different etiquettes and values in their speakers.  My thoughts were that monolingual cultures demand that multilingual speakers change their language use to accommodate monolingual speakers (including, say, when the latter are the minority in a conversation), and it is rude to 'exclude' monolinguals through language choice.  Whereas multilingual cultures demand that monolingual speakers do their best to fit in with multilingual conversations, and it is rude to demand that others change or limit their language choice to suit oneself.  Is there any substance to this whether in these terms or from a different angle? If so are there some interesting literatures to explore?  I realise there's a political aspect to this, for example attitudes towards and of English speakers both in English-speaking countries and non-English speaking countries. I'm not trying to ask a political or moral question though, nor am I trying to use this thread to score any points for either 'team', just genuinely curious about the wider anthropological dimension around some of these experiences.  Fwiw I have a social science background but am not an anthropologist. I also grew up/live in a monolingual country but have lived in multilingual countries and am part of an extended family whose members split into three different first languages.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Welcome to the fascinating world of linguistic anthropology!  It sounds to me like what you’re discussing is language ideologies. Broadly speaking, this refers to the set of ideas and beliefs about language use that come to be shared to a greater or lesser extent by a community. These beliefs usually include some set of evaluative norms for language use that include—among other things—conventions about the appropriateness of one code (i.e., language or language variety) versus another depending on the social context.  These beliefs about appropriate or correct language use are then frequently transformed into beliefs and attitudes about a language’s speakers. For instance, if a culture values monolingualism, speakers whose behavior does not meet this expectation will be negatively evaluated. This stems from the fact that, first of all, the non-conforming individual is using a code that is not valued within that cultural frame. Second, that negative evaluation gets transposed onto the speaker themself. Under such a system, it’s clear there will be behavioral effects in the given community.  While most discussions of language ideology are grounded in a particular geopolitical context (e.g., the relationship between Catalan, Spanish, and their speakers in Catalonia), these could certainly be applied to the more abstract notions of monolingualism and multilingualism more generally."

The ancient religions of the Egyptians and old history seem to long be forgotten in the current times.. is it fair to assume the same for the religious beliefs of now to fade with time as well.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " First of all, classic anthropology isn't a discipline that is based on predicative models.  Especially American anthropology -- which was in large part created by Franz Boas largely to \"salvage\" sources of indigenous knowledge, wisdom, and cultural aspects in hopes of creating a repository of data that could one day be used to identify structural components of human thought and culture.  &#x200B;  The TLDR of the above paragraph being, \"We don't foretell the distant future.\"  Otherwise we'd all be bestselling scifi authors, military consultants, and crystal ball seers.  &#x200B;  A book you might find interesting is Malvin Harris's \"Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches.\"  In it, he analyzes classic religious practices and figures out underlying functions that they serve in cultures.  An easy example is the sacredness of cows in India.  Harris came to the conclusion that this was a practice that evolved from the underlying usefulness of cows in that particular area of the world.  A well-kept cow provides milk, yogurt calves, plowing of fields, manure for fertilization... many benefits beyond that of beef meat.  As such, it became ingrained in culture that cows were not for eating.  In essence, beliefs have a function.  Otherwise they don't stick around.  Obviously Ancient Egyptian religion (from around 5000 years ago)  has not provided that function, and therefore has not persisted.  The predominant religion in the world, Christianity, has been around for 2000 years, has probably provided the world with some function during that time, or else it would no longer exist; it is, however, shrinking.  Hinduism is upwards of 3500 years old; Buddhism around 2500.  Currently the fastest growing religions are Islam and atheistic/none.  One has to assume that each of these has a specific function, and that people are drawn to them based on their need at that point in time.   Religious beliefs as a whole exist far beyond recorded history.  So to answer your question: if there is a function of religion in ensuring the mental health of a given group of humans, it will continue to exist.  I see our future plagued with a number of uncertainties in the future, and religion is most effective when used to account for factors beyond our control.  We likely will have an impending refugee crisis in the near future as climate change forces demographic movements like nothing we've ever seen; I'd predict religion to be present through that.  Should we make it to a space age -- as I would hope -- then I have no doubt that careful scientific knowledge and atheism will be very prevalent; I wouldn't be surprised if new religions arrive to fill the new gaps in knowledge that we will inevitable have.  We have yet to figure out whether or not we'll be around as a species for the next 200 years.  I'm more worried about that.  But I -- personally -- have little doubt that religion, in some way, shape, or form, is pretty universal, and pretty integral to the human state of mind."

And said something about progress and stuff and that high level complex communities and societies are unnatural and against our nature.  So were all human societies back then before let's say agricultural societies arose egalitarian? And how egalitarian were they?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Instead of debating the point, I would ask your friend to dig more deeply into what she means by \"natural.\"  Does she mean biological?  Because if so, if humans are capable of a behavior, then it is a natural behavior.  If it was not biologically possible it would not happen.  If natural does not mean biological, then what does it mean?  God given?  I bet your friend doesn't believe in God creating a list of acceptable behaviors that we all have to follow.  So then what do we mean by natural?  I am guessing what she means is that humans have created social systems that cause suffering for large numbers of people, and that that feels so wrong to her, that she wants to label it \"unnatural.\"  I completely understand that feeling and if I am honest I am also drawn to the idea that humans have created an \"unnatural\" world.  But if I take a step back and think like a social scientist, I realize that the term \"natural\" is just not defined in any way we can measure.  We have to stop looking at the past in order to prove that our way of thinking about the best kind of social organization is more objectively supported than someone else's.  That is terrible science.  The truth is that based on all the evidence we have from history and archaeology, humans are capable of creating unequal societies with high levels of suffering for oppressed groups.  We are also capable of creating unequal societies with low levels of suffering for oppressed groups, and more egalitarian societies where suffering is more or less equally shared.  There is no perfectly egalitarian society (gender and age have always shaped people's status and relationship to the group), but there are societies where everyone gets their basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and companionship met, and where everyone does useful labor and is seen as fully human.  But even in those more egalitarian societies people may be cast out and rejected if they are seen to be harmful enough to the group.  I would recommend the book The Dawn of Everything by Graeber and Wengrow to your friend.  While not a definitive statement of the truth about human history, it does contain lots of good data on the periods just before and during the development of agriculture.  It raised many interesting questions about whether long standing assumptions of egalitarianism and inequality are supported by the data."

    "golden_answer": " Someone else mentioned *Debt: The First 5,000 Years*. I'd also suggest *Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value*, also by David Graeber, because it talks about how questions about markets have shaped almost all other areas of social theory.  A lot of key debates in social theory have been focused on the broad question of the relationship between society and individual. Does social structure determine the full range of possible human behaviour, or is it in fact individual agency that makes social structure possible in the first place?  Most mainstream sociological/anthropological responses to this question can be traced back to very specific debates about the nature of markets. At its height from the 1950s to the 70s, this debate was known as the Substantivist vs. Formalist debate.  So, for example, most individual-centric social theories even today tend to come from the Formalist position that humans are, at heart, creatures that maximize self-interest, like the *Homo Economicus* of economics.   On the other hand, most theories about social structure can find their origins in the works of people like Karl Polanyi or Bronislaw Malinowski, who argued for the \"embeddedness\" of markets: there was no independent entity called the market. Market relations were simply a means for social structure to preserve itself, through relations of solidarity and obligation.  Graeber's point is twofold: firstly, to show how questions about the nature of markets almost inevitably end up becoming questions about social life in its totality. Secondly, he wants to show how even the most \"cutting edge\" social theories, in many ways, haven't really come all that far from ideas that were being discussed by scholars decades ago."

Bad anthropology?   The multi-tiered university undergraduate and graduate education that professional anthropologists go through is designed and intended to hammer home the idea that idealizing a culture-- any culture-- isn't good anthropological practice.  This is why cultural relativism is so important in the practice of anthropology. There is no such thing as a perfect human culture. Every culture that we are aware of has had its own internal problems of one sort or another. We approach the examination of cultures (to the best of our abilities) through their own internal lens. And in so doing, our goal is not only to reserve ethnocentric judgment (good or bad) of a culture and its myriad practices and traditions, but also to maintain a sense of analytic detachment. That doesn't mean that anthropologists don't become attached to the people and cultures that they study and spend time interacting with. But what it *does* mean is that we avoid idealizing the people and cultures we work with by approaching *any* culture with a relativistic perspective and do our best not to impose our own values and morals on people who don't necessarily share those same values or morals.  Anthropologists are human, of course, and so we *do* make plenty of mistakes in the practice of our discipline, as any human does. This is also why we have things like peer review, institutional review boards (IRBs), and so forth. We have built many checks and balances into our discipline (as have other research / academic disciplines) that are designed to help maintain a certain standard of research, ethical behavior, data development / recordation, and reporting.

What does it mean to be wealthy in societies without money, or in societies where hoarding goods does not translate into status?   This is a bit esoteric, but I think that James Ferguson's 1992 article \"The Cultural Topography of Wealth\" gives a good introduction to thinking about multiple understandings of property. It relates directly to Paul Bohannon's work on spheres of exchange among the Tiv (see the wikipedia page on it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheres_of_exchange )."
