    "golden_answer": " Fluffeh's response is actually somewhat incorrect, though commonly believed to be true.   While there is some contribution to the discrepancy in the sound of one's voice as a result of damping through bone conduction, the major reason is actually something known as the pre-vocalization reflex.    There's a great description of it here, but to summarize, essentially any time you are about to say something, cranial nerves fire in order to ensure that your hearing is dampened at that time, thereby making your voice sound different to yourself. If the function of these cranial nerves is harmed (Bell's Palsy), then you no longer hear yourself the way that you used to hear yourself. (Which is actually one of the symptoms for the disease)."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If a giant asteroid (large enough to destroy the earth) was heading straight for us, at what point in the impact timeline would we be able to see it with the naked eye? Once we could see it, how quickly would it grow larger until it blotted out the rest of the sky?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There is a lot that's not really given to us. The visibility of an object depends on several factors, a few of which are listed below:  1. Albedo - i.e. how reflective it is. Asteroids aren't very reflective because they're made of greyish rocks. Comets are pretty bright because they're made of ice that vents off as it nears the sun, creating a large reflective surface.  2. Size - as you asked, the bigger the reflector, the more likely it is to reflect enough light to see  3. Angle of Approach - We usually detect stuff because one day it looks like it's a star in one place, the next it's moved relative to the background stars. Example In the example you can see the asteroid moved WRT the background stars. There are geometries that would show no change in angle, which would make this sort of detection REALLY hard to see.  4. Distance from Sun - Closer to the sun more light hits the asteroid so more light can reflect off of it.   5. Where WE are looking - We have to have telescopes pointed in the right direction to see it. Telescopes have a pretty narrow field usually and are dedicated to other tasks than finding meteors/asteroids/comets.  So those 5 factors are huge when finding a meteor. Comets are typically easier because they produce a big gas cloud (the tail) that reflects lots of light from the sun. It's a big target for us to see in the night sky and relatively bright. Meteors/asteroids don't do that. They are usually pretty tough to find.  A meteor the size of a US Aircraft carrier can't be seen with the naked eye when it even passes between the moon and Earth: NASA Gets pics of Aircraft Carrier Sized asteroid passing closer than the moon  So something a few miles across can't be seen.  The truth, we would probably see a comet a good ways off as it started to heat up and vent gasses from its surface. Haley's comet can be seen  a few million miles away. Large meteors/asteroids can pass very close to earth and not be seen at all.   For it to completely block out the sky it would need to fill your entire field of view, which means it's either a few inches from your face (your hand can do this) or it's really really big. Imagine a bud above you. How far does it need to block your view of the sky? Now imagine a building, a city, a mountain, etc. The bigger the object, the further away it can be. The moon is really big (1/6th the size of the Earth), but even at only 280,000miles, it barely filled a spot in the sky the size of your thumbnail at arms length. So a rock that's billions of times smaller than the moon (which is about the size of a mountain) would need to be REALLY close - and in fact it would be burning up in the atmosphere before it blocked out the sky.  Hope that helps. :D"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If childbirth is one of the most painful experiences one can go through, how come it does not render the person unconscious as when having other forms of pain inflicted?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Most doctors and physiologists consider pain to be an activating stimulus rather than something that causes you to lose consciousness.  For example, when patients are undergoing an operation it is often necessary to increase the amount of anesthetic they are receiving once the surgeon begins to cut the patient.  Even though the patient was fully anesthetized before the cutting began, the pain of being cut activates their sympathetic and central nervous system and causes vital sign changes and occasionally limb movement. This OR observation is consistent with the fact that the intense pain of childbirth does not cause depressed consciousness, but actually the opposite. Thinking from an evolutionary point of view, increased sympathetic tone (i.e. increased awareness, heart rate, blood pressure, and pupillary dilatation) would be a very advantageous response to pain in many situations (such as when an animal is attempting to eat you). You can also verify this at home by providing painful stimulus to someone who is asleep and noting how their level of alertness changes afterwards.  The perception that pain causes people to go unconscious is probably based on two separate physiologic processes. The more severe of the two is called shock. Shock is a pathologic state where the cardiovascular system can no longer provide adequate perfusion to vital organs, particularly the brain. Shock has multiple causes but the one most pertinent to this question is hypovolemic shock secondary to trauma and blood loss. This occurs when there is simply not enough blood in the body. Once enough blood is lost, the brain becomes hypoxic, conciousness becomes depressed, and the patient will shortly thereafter die. Someone witnessing this process might incorrectly assume that the pain associated with this person's injuries is causing them to go unconscious. Another more benign explanation for the perception that pain causes unconsciousness is something called vasovagal syncope. This is stimulation of the vagus nerve, which activates the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in hypotension, bradycardia (slow heart rate), and possibly temporary hypoperfusion of the brain. The vagal nerve can be stimulated in many ways. Common causes are the sight of blood or other disturbing sights, extreme emotional duress, and straining during a bowel movement. It is common for someone who is hurt to look at their injury and have a resulting episode of vasovagal syncope, which to an observer might be attributed to pain.  http://www.dana.org/news/brainhealth/detail.aspx?id=10072 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001220/ http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovagal-syncope/DS00806"

There are reports of larger lobsters from the colonial era, but it's unclear exactly how reliable they were.  Lobsters continue growing for as long as they are healthy, but molting becomes more difficult as they age, and molting lobsters are more vulnerable to predators.  I suspect maximum lobster is a bit bigger than the biggest known...if one was kept in idea environment with no predators, the best in lobster healthcare, and plenty of food, it ought to be able to successfully molt at larger sizes than wild lobsters.  But how much bigger, it's hard to say for sure.  It probably wouldn't be a huge difference, certainly not car sized.

    "golden_answer": " No. As others have stated, time dilation messes around with the passage of time, and some parts of the universe will have experienced a different passage of time since the Big Bang.   The one remaining piece of the puzzle, however, is asking the question: if the universe is 14bn years old.....says who?  Which reference frame do we use when we make such a powerful, general statement -- when we are using a framework (GR) where the idea of objective time doesn't make sense?  The answer lies in the fact that, although GR forbids us from choosing a universal reference frame as \"the truth\", it doesn't forbid us from using an *obvious* reference frame as a standard measure. When we say \"the universe is 13.77bn years old\" there is an unspoken addition to the end of the sentence which says \"in the standard cosmological reference frame.\"  So what is this standard reference frame, and why is it obvious?   One of the foundations of the theory of modern cosmology is the quasi-observed \"fact\"* that, above a certain lengthscale, the universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. That is, if you zoom out enough (looking at the scales of hundreds of  millions of lightyears), the universe appears to be made up of a uniform, *stationary* cosmological fluid. Our galaxies are simply perturbations in the density of this fluid.   It is this fluid with which we define our reference frame -- and we can measure how fast we are moving with respect to that frame by using the CMB dipole -- given that the CMB should be isotropic in the cosmological frame. We can see that we are moving at about ~600km/sec with respect to the CMB, and hence the cosmological reference frame.  Remember, there's nothing inherently *special* about this frame, it is merely the most convenient one for cosmologists to use as a basis for doing these kind of calculations.    *Why did I say quasi-observed? Because most people would say that we haven't observed any deviations yet, which is not the same as having observed it. One of my colleagues, Professor Subir Sarkar, believes he has spotted such a deviation, though the matter is still controversial.  [Edit: Some formatting]"

The data so far suggests that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it several times more severe than typical seasonal influenza and would put it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).  Second, COVID-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others. That’s an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or not even showing symptoms yet. This means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which were only spread by those showing symptoms and were much less efficiently transmitted.

    "golden_answer": " Pet cockatiels can have night frights, because of their flock nature. This is because of the way they sleep in a flock. The birds towards the edge of the flock sleep more lightly, so if danger appears they can fly away. The activity stirs the rest of them from sleep but they start flying before the fully asleep ones wake up.  Birds who live in a safe home environment sleep fully, so unexpected noises in the middle of the night can result in them flying in response before they're awake.  Said flight causes them to hit the cage. If it's still dark this can result in them panicking in sort of a half awake half asleep fashion and they can often hurt themselves in this process.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If you were a human floating towards the sun, at what distance from the sun would you feel an Earth-like temperature?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " tl;dr: If you're near Earth's orbit, you're already way too close. You'd need to drift outward quite a bit.   On Earth, if you leave something lying in the sun indefinitely, it will heat up until the heat it loses to the surrounding air (and the ground) is balanced with the heat it absorbs from the sun. In space, it works the same way, except that without air, the only way for an object to lose heat is by radiation (infrared, at normal body temperatures).  If we want to keep our body temperature roughly constant, the heat we radiate needs to balance out the heat we absorb from the sun plus the heat generated by our own metabolism.  I found a page estimating our own power output as 100W. Let's say we are a perfect blackbody radiator with a surface area of 2m^2 and our skin were to be 307K - we're in \"spherical cow\" territory here, but this should be the right order of magnitude.  The power our skin radiates is then given by the Stefan-Boltzman law as 5.67e-8 Wm^(-2)K^(-4), or 5.67e-8 * 2 * 307^4 W = about 1000W. (So the good news is, we're losing more heat than we produce on our own, even without air-cooling. Without the sun, we'd freeze instead of overheating.)  So how much sun do we need? This one is a bit more complicated, because it depends on how we're oriented. The bigger our cross-section facing the sun, the more we absorb.  The total power output of the sun is 3.828e26 W. To get around 1000W of that, we need to capture 1 part in 3.828e23. So if we present a cross-section of about 1m^2, then our distance should be the radius of a sphere with a surface area of 3.828e23 m^2.  Result: 1.75e11 meters, or about 9.7 light minutes. To give you a picture, Earth's and Mars's orbits are about 8.3 and 12.5 light minutes from the sun on average, so we'd have to go (very, very roughly) a third of the way from Earth to Mars orbit to feel comfortable.  (Not double-checked; it's entirely possible there's a massive error in the above calculation, on top of all the ballpark guessing.)  Edit: Mind you, the ballpark guessing already introduces some *wild* inaccuracy. If we drop the cross section to 0.5m^2, suddenly we're closer to 6.9 light minutes. And we're not perfect blackbody radiators, anyway."

    "golden_answer": " There's a couple different ways, but the 3 easiest to understand are brightness, parallax and redshift.  **Brightness** is straightforward. Things further away are dimmer. You can tell how bright a star should be by how big it is, and you can tell how big a star is by how things move around it -- the strength of the star's gravity is related to its mass. If you measure the brightness carefully with a telescope, and you know how bright it should be based on the mass, you can get a decent estimate of how far away it is.   **Parallax** is how things move relative to each other based on distance. So, for example, hold a thumb up in front of your face and look at it while winking with each eye. You'll see the thumb move left-right much more than the background. That's the parallax effect. Closer things move more than further-away things.   So for stars, we take a picture of them at opposite points in Earth's orbit. For example, we might take pictures in summer and winter, or fall and spring. The pictures are similar to your eyes winking back and forth -- and some stars move more than others. So from that we can tell relative distances between the stars. If you know relative distances from this, and you know an absolute distance for one of the stars (say from a brightness measurement), now you know the distances of the other stars.  Lastly, **redshift**. This is basically just the Doppler Effect for light. Doppler is what happens when a train or ambulance zips by -- you hear the high-pitched sound and as it zooms past it changes to a low sound. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooo. The actual sound is the same the whole time, but what's happening is that as it comes toward you, the sound waves bunch up, so it gets higher-pitched. As it leaves, they get stretched out, so it's lower-pitched. The same thing happens to light at very high speeds. Stuff coming toward you really fast would look BLUER, and stuff moving away fast would look REDDER.   Because of the Big Bang, everything is moving away from everything else. So starlight is redder than it should be. The redder it is, the faster it's moving away. And because of some interesting math with the Big Bang, the faster it's moving away, the further away it is."

What properties do they differ that allows one acid to be stronger than the other?\" . . . and eventually my teacher just said \"I don't know.\" Needless to say I'm unsatisfied, any help please?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Several factors must be considered, here are the main ones:  Electronegativity - this is most commonly understood and talked about.  The more electronegative the atom bonded to the proton is, the more easily that bond will break heterolytically (both electrons go with one partner, aka the leaving group).  It makes sense because it is easy to imagine something that is much more electronegative than hydrogen taking both of the electrons in the bond which allows hydrogen to dissassociate.  Fluorine, chlorine, oxygen check this box.  Stabilization of the anion - The conjugate base of an acid usually has a negative charge, and that negative charge represents an instability for that molecule.  The more the negative charge can be spread throughout the molecule via a system of conjugation, the more stable it will be and, conversely, the more tightly focused that negative charge is on, say, a single atom for example, the less stable it is.  For example, bisulfate is able to spread its negative charge between three different oxygen atoms, contributing to its stability.  Conversely, fluoride is a tiny atom with its negative charge tightly focused, which is a significant contributing factor in fluoride not fully dissociating as you would expect based on electronegativity alone.  There are also many extreme examples of anion stability in large conjugated systems in organic acids, especially in cases where the freeing up of the electron pair enables a much larger conjugated system by joining two smaller ones  (or, better yet, an aromatic system!).  The stability of conjugate bases is a part of a larger topic in chemistry about the stability of leaving groups, the same principle applies.  People frequently use pKa as a good measure of the stability of a conjugate base or leaving group.  Solvent stabilizing effects - When we are talking about acids, we are always talking about water as the solvent, but the chemical structure of the acid and the solutes in the water can vary, which can significantly impact the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of the solvent on the proton and anion of a dissociated acid.  For example, organic acids usually get a boost in their dissociation in water because of their inherent instability in water - dissociating in to a pair of ions frequently increases their stability in water.  Also, solutes in water can increase or decrease the ability for water to stabilize ions created in the dissociation of acids.  Edit:  The answer to your sulfuric acid, chloride question requires an additional consideration.  Oxygen is more electronegative than chloride, sure, but due to the valency of oxygen, it is always bonded with something other than the proton and since oxygen is more electronegative than everything other than fluorine, whatever else oxygen is bonded to is always donating (relatively speaking) electric charge to the oxygen, making oxygen less able to pull electrons away from the proton.  Having said that, though, sulfuric acid is still one of the stronger oxyacids due to its ability to spread out that negative charge.  So based on this you would expect oxyacids which are bonded to carbon rather than sulfur to be less acidid because carbon is less electronegative than sulfur.  Hope that helps."

    "golden_answer": " You're thinking of the sidereal day. That's how long it takes the earth to rotate 360 degrees with respect to the stars. A solar day is a 360 degree rotation with respect to the sun, or the amount of time between two successive \"noons.\"   Because we made a little progress in our orbit today, the earth needs to spin a little extra to get to noon in order to account for the fact that the sun has moved relative to the earth while we were going about our day.   This little extra spin is about four minutes, making the solar day right on to 24 hours. Sometimes we add leap seconds to keep everything working smoothly."

    "golden_answer": " I believe it is an inaccurate statement.  They are misapplying the Landauer Limit which states the theoretical minimum entropy change (and thus energy required) to change a bit of information.  Since energy equates to mass (e=mc\\^2), you can frame this energy as mass.  In fact, if you take the value from the wikipedia article (2.805 zeptoJoules) and run it through e=mc\\^2, you wind up with 31 quectograms, which is I'm sure where they got the value in the article.  However- this is a theoretical minimum amount of energy (which would be converted to heat) needed to change a bit of information in a perfectly efficient computer.  So wrong for two reasons:  1) Your mobile phone is not nearly this efficient.  By many, many orders of magnitude.   2) It does not change the mass of the computing device.  The energy came in a low-entropy form from a battery, and converts to a high-entropy form as heat.  The energy is neither created nor destroyed, the mass of the device does not change (until that heat is radiated away, which is a completely separate issue).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s\\_principle"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: There is increasing evidence that COVID-19 affects the brain. Is there a similar effect for other coronaviruses (like the ones that cause the common cold), or is it specific to SARS-CoV-2?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) does affect the brain more often and to a greater degree than most common cold viruses, but brain involvement during viral infection is not unique to COVID-19. Many other viruses can affect the brain, including other coronaviruses. See this page for a summary of viruses that can directly affect the brain.  Here's a quote from a 2018 review paper talking about coronaviruses in general, before the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered: \"As described so far, coronaviruses are respiratory viruses that exhibit neurotropic capacities that not only allows them to achieve latency and avoid the immune response of the host, but also have neurological implications that can complicate the disease associated to its infection.\"  In other words, even in 2018, it was known that coronaviruses can affect the brain. With that said, the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, not coronaviruses. It's very rare for rhinovirus infections to directly involve the brain (source, source). Still, rhinovirus infection can indirectly affect the brain by inducing cytokine release that causes things like fever and sickness behavior. Sometimes fevers from the common cold can even lead to seizures, but this is relatively rare and usually only happens in young children (source, source). The common cold does not usually cause high fevers in adults (source), but again can still indirectly affect the brain by causing low mood, fatigue, brain fog, etc. (source).  Unlike the common cold, COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly affect the brain in multiple ways (source, source, source). As one paper writes, \"There is enough evidence to conclude that neurological symptoms and complications are an important feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 prompts a range of neurological complications, from common and somewhat mild symptoms, such as transient anosmia and ageusia; to more severe complications, albeit rarer, such as stroke, encephalitis or encephalopathy.\"  **tldr:** COVID-19 affects the brain more than the common cold virus, but other viruses can still affect the brain."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: when I shine a flashlight at Mars, does a small amount of the light actually reach it?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yes, you need to be careful with phrases like \"a small amount\".   Mars is around 225 million km away at ~~closest approach~~ average distance.  Lets say you have a 1W flashlight and aim it at Mars, the intensity very far away from this flashlight will drop off as the distance squared (also a little extra from absorption and scattering in the atmosphere).  Without doing any exact calculations, if we assume scattering is negligible we can say the intensity that hits Mars will be larger than  I > 1W / (2 pi * (225 million km)^2) ~ 3 × 10^-24 W /m^2  Mars has a surface area of 144.8 million km², so the power hitting Mars will be around  I * A/4 ~ 2.3 × 10^-10 W  This isn't a lot of power, but a single photon at optical wavelengths has an energy of around 3 × 10^-19 J, so this is still billions of photons a second hitting Mars.    Edit: Lots of people are pointing out the beam divergence and scattering I ignored. Scattering I still don't think is very significant, about a fraction 10^−5 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel, most of earths atmosphere is within 20 km of the surface so the intensity is reduced by a factor of around  I/I_0 = exp(-20000*10^-5) ~ 0.8  which is a 20% loss and thus not significant.  If you aimed the beam through more atmosphere or if you had a blue flashlight this gets worse, but never significant.  The beam divergence depends heavily on how wide a flashlight you have to start with, if you had something which is quite compact the divergence is worse than something with a large output.  Most of the power is actually in a spherical segment which is, say, 30 degrees in size, where as my calculation assumed this was closer to 90 degrees.  To compensate the intensity on Mars would be bigger by a factor of  (90/30)^2 = 9 ~ 10."

Another interesting consequence of this is phantom limb syndrome, which can happen when someone loses a limb that had motor and sensory cortex devoted to it. Essentially, other nearby regions start taking over the available real estate, because theres a fair amount of plasticity. So occasionally inputs can trigger the neurons that used to represent the arm to fire, causing the sensation of pain/itching/etc in an arm that is no longer there. This paper describes how monkey somatosensory cortexes remap.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How effective is the vaccine against each of the different covid variants? i'm specifically talking about comparing the OG virus against the South African variant, the British variant and the Delta variant. is there any (noticeable) difference in how effective the vaccine is?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " This is a much more complicated question than you might think. Which vaccine? Protection against infection, transmission, hospitalization, death? How long after vaccination? Actual protection, or surrogate measures like antibody titers?  What age group?  —and of course these all overlap, so asking about protection against hospitalization in elderly people 8 months after vaccination in the UK might not tell you much about protection against infection in 30-year-olds in the US.  The ballpark answer is that alpha and delta have minor to moderate reductions in vaccine efficacy, and beta has a larger reduction, relative to the original strain. Putting together a bunch of studies, and simplifying wildly, if you’re starting with an mRNA vaccine and you received it fairly recently you might have 95% protection against symptomatic disease from the original strain, maybe 80-90% protection against symptomatic disease from alpha and delta, and maybe 60-75% against beta. Scale all those numbers down some if you’re further out from your vaccine, if you’re asking about protection against asymptomatic infection, if you’re elderly or immune compromised.   Another way to look at it is to ask how much difference in antibody concentration you need to neutralize the same numbers of each virus. If you need 1x amount of antibody to neutralize your little vial of original strain, you might need 5x that amount for alpha and delta, and 8-12x as much for beta. Antibody titers don’t correlate linearly with protection, and a ballpark estimate might be that mRNA vaccines give you 10-50x as many antibodies as you need for protection, against original strain, on day 1.  So if antibodies wane by half over a year, you might still be protected against original strain, but mildly susceptible to delta.   Bottom line is that alpha and delta (as well as the D614G mutation that appeared early in 2020 and that everyone has already forgotten about) are mainly transmission-enhancing variants, with immune evasion as a mostly accidental side effect. The beta variant seemed to be more of an immune evasion variant without much transmission enhancement, and so it’s not surprising it was outcompeted and seems to be fading away.   There’s very little published on some other variants of concern. “Mu” never really was a cause for concern, just media hysteria. Lambda is more of a concern, but I don’t know of any good comparative immunity studies on it. It’s behaving more like a moderate transmission variant that’s outcompeted by delta, but who knows.  This tweet, from a well respected virologist, has the beginnings of a table comparing delta immunity to previous strains, and gives a sense of how complicated the question is and how much variation in the answers there is depending on the study - a reminder that scientists almost never rely on a single paper for conclusions and really want to see many different groups ask the question in many different ways before having any trust in the conclus8on."

And no, it isn't just your brain, your ENTIRE nervous system has a left and right side that are mirror images.   And don't believe the forebrain was a single mass that was selected to split. Remember, the chordate nervous system originates as a hollow tube which closes at the tips (if it doesn't close, you get Spina Bifida or anacephaly), then the walls keep growing in thickness. And this is the embryonic brain  However, remember, the tip of the neural tube is not the frontal lobe of the brain, but the lamina terminalis, which is pretty much in the center of the head, just above the optic chiasm. The hemispheres are LATERAL outgrowths, they are the left and right side of the tube, which grow on their own to the point they cover the remaining parts (in birds and mammals pretty much tho).

    "golden_answer": " I think a lot of these answers are missing the point.

Over a lifetime, that means around 140 tonnes of waste. Typical density of waste varies greatly, but tends to be around 300kg/m^3 before compaction, and up to 600kg/m^3 after.  I assume you're more interested in the non-compacted waste, so that results in a landfill of around 450m^3.

    "golden_answer": " TL;DR -  FDA approval is designed on purpose to be a *slow ass process* to make sure a product is **safe, pure, and potent.** It's a process made hard on purpose.   Meanwhile, an emergency use authorization slims down the red tape while still requiring a proven safety and efficacy record.   **ETA:** If normal FDA approval is like a 300-guest wedding event, then emergency use authorization is a small courthouse wedding six months in advance of the main event so that they can file joint taxes and one spouse can technically be on the other's health insurance and dental.   ---  Right now the FDA has cleared just three of many vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) for use via Emergency Use Authroization (EUA). To get there, they had to go through three phases, and at each stage demonstrate both a) effectiveness and b) safety.   - Phase 1: given to a small number of healthy people to see if it's safe at various doses and prompts an immune response (if OK, move to 2) - Phase 2: given to hundreds of people, randomized and controlled, to see short term side effects and immune response at varying doses (if no major short term side effects, move to 3) - Phase 3: given to thousands of people to measure effectiveness and more safety information vs. a placebo  >For an EUA to be issued for a vaccine, for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure quality and consistency, FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.  > From a safety perspective, FDA expects an **EUA submission will include all safety data accumulated from phase 1 and 2 studies conducted with the vaccine, with an expectation that phase 3 data will include a median follow-up of at least 2-months** (meaning that at least half of vaccine recipients in phase 3 clinical trials have at least 2 months of follow-up) after completion of the full vaccination regimen. In addition, FDA expects that an EUA request will include a phase 3 safety database of well over 3,000 vaccine recipients, representing a high proportion of participants enrolled in the phase 3 study, who have been followed for serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest for at least one month after completion of the full vaccination regimen.  So far only 3 have made it to EUA. **That means we know it works, we know *for sure* it's safe in the short term, and we know it's manufactured correctly and consistently.** You have a vaccine, you proved it works, and you proved it's safe - you can produce it while you go through the rest of the slow-on-purpose process.  Now to have full approval, and under normal circumstances, the vaccine makers have to get full approval through a **Biologics License Application (BLA)** submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. This is a 3-stage process.  The BLA application itself includes:  - Applicant information  - Product/Manufacturing information  - Pre-clinical studies  - Clinical studies  - Labeling  1. They schedule a bioresearch monitoring inspection. FDA comes out to inspect the production process and facilities.  2. Then they file a Form FDA 356th which includes:  - A summary of information submitted as part of the application.  - Information on the applicant submitting the biologics license application.  - A preclinical data section.  - A clinical data section that includes safety and efficacy data on the product.  - Draft labeling of the product to be licensed.  - Information on the manufacturing, chemistry, and controls of the product.  - A data summary of validation of important processes and assays involved in the manufacture of the product.  - A description of the facility where the product is manufactured.  - Case report form tabulations on the manufacturer’s clinical experience with the product.  - Case report forms and serious event narratives.  - An index.  3.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Will breathing in pure oxygen allow you to hold your breath longer? Since air in the atmosphere is composed of ~20% oxygen, if you breathe in 100% pure oxygen would you be able to hold your breath for longer?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The short answer is: yes, absolutely.  Some lung and respiratory mechanics are needed to understand the long answer.  First point: Your lungs don't fully empty when you exhale.  In fact, during normal breathing you only move maybe 1/5 to 1/4 of the volume you can breath: this is your \"tidal volume\".  Example: exhale to whatever \"comfortable\" point you feel like marks the end of a normal breath for you.  Now force out as much more air as you can on top of that.  Most people with healthy lungs can force a lot more air out - this is the \"expiratory reserve\" and serves as a backup for when you're running or exerting yourself.  Same with the inhalation side - you can inhale a lot more than you do during normal breathing, and this is called (surprise) the inspiratory reserve volume. No matter how much you exhale, however, there is always some portion of air left in your lungs that you can't force out because you can't squish your ribcage completely flat.  This is called the \"reserve volume\".  The reserve volume + the expiratory reserve volume is called the Functional Residual Capacity and is where gas exchange with the lungs actually takes place.  Second point: Our brains are not driven by oxygen to breath.  They're driven by carbon dioxide (actually hydrogen ion concentration but that's a long story).  The higher your carbon dioxide level goes the more intensely you feel the need to breath.  You'll feel burning in your limbs and your brain, thanks to millions of years of evolution, will be screaming at you to do something as it thinks it's suffocating.  Oxygen drive exists, but usually only becomes active in people who have smoked for 30-40 years (and pretty much killed their CO2 drive).  Okay, so now the more detailed answer: The air we breath is 21% oxygen.  By inhaling 100% oxygen for a couple of minutes (enough to washout the nitrogen from the functional residual capacity in your lungs), you can pretty much hold your breath about 4-5 times longer than normal.  Anesthesiologists routinely do this before putting patients out as a safety thing (hence the mask when you \"go off to sleep\") because in an emergency the patient can usually \"hold\" his or her breath for 5-10 minutes after breathing 100% oxygen.  And this works because the patient is already unconscious and can't feel his/her CO2 level rising.    Doing this awake, however, is very difficult as you can feel that CO2 rise and even though your lungs are still full of oxygen your brain will be freaking out and demanding that you take a breath.  It is possible to overcome that breath instinct, however, with some training or serious dedication.  This is part of the reason that hyperventilation (really rapid deep breathing) before breath holding helps you hold your breath - you drive your CO2 level way down and it takes longer for your brain to reach the freakout point while you're breath-holding.  This is also why it's dangerous to do so: while that CO2 level is rising again you may well burn through your oxygen reserve (and since your brain still feels fine with regards to CO2) you can lose consciousness from hypoxia.  Fun, right?  Source: IAMA Anesthesiologist  Edit: Groshe pointed out I mis-defined FRC.  Corrected it."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do we know we’ve discovered a new species of human based on a single fossil, and not just a really ugly dude? This article claims they’ve discovered a new species of human, which is awesome, but since the claim is based off a single fossil, how do we know that it wasn’t just one person with some sort of genetic defect?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I'll start by saying that we actually don't know if this is a new human species or not. The authors who found this fossil argue that it is because:  > \"A combination of primitive and derived features in the Harbin cranium establishes a good set of diagnostic features that were used to define a new Homo species.\" via Shao et al: https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00056-4, published yesterday.   Basically, there are certain features that tend to be specifically diagnostic of species difference when we look at hominids. Things like brain size, face length, brow size, tooth differences, cheek bone size, etc. The reason we look at these things is because they tend to be variable between species, but fairly consistent within species. And, even in cases where one or more of these traits is variable (e.g., a baby born with microcephaly), all the concomitant traits probably won't change much. For example, the authors note that this fossil has a mix of features that are commonly seen in more human-like hominids, and those more common in \"primitive\" hominids:   Like humans: > \"large cranial capacity, short face, and small check bones\"   More \"primitive:\" > \"low vault, strong browridges, large molars, and alveolar prognathism\" via Ni et al: https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2, published yesterday.   Because this combination of traits isn't known in any other hominid, and because it doesn't seem to showcase signs of any known disease or deformity, it's unlikely (although never impossible) that this is just, like, some guy who looked real weird.    Still, the leap that this is a brand new species just from one skull is problematic. First of all, there are known species of hominid that have unknown skull structures. The article you linked to mentions Devisovans as an example of this. They are a close relative species of ours, and some people of east Asian descent have their DNA in their genomes! We only know they exist because we sequenced the DNA of some non-skull bones, so we have no idea what their heads would have looked like. That means it's possible that this is just a skull of a species we already knew about. Even if this is the case, that's still a really cool find!    I should also mention that even if this is a species we already knew about, it's almost certainly not *H. sapiens*, as the time and place it was found doesn't match up with human migration. Present evidence suggests that modern humans probably didn't make it to East Asia until about 50,000 years ago, and this individual lived in present day China over 146,000 years ago."

OJ 287 and TON 618 are both in the billions of light-years away from us.   As we look into the distant universe, we are also looking back in time, due to the time it takes the light to travel to us from there. Therefore, we are seeing these ultramassive black holes as they were billions of years ago. But black holes, as far as we understand them, tend to only grow over time. Shouldn't we therefore expect to see smaller black holes when we look back in time, and larger black holes closer to the present, nearer to us?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do plants maintain a characteristic \"body temperature\" and if so, how is this temperature regulated?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Plants are typically ectothermic, with limited regulation of internal temperature. They can still employ clever tricks like orienting their leaves to collect less light at noon to prevent overheating, but without any strict regulation of their temperature.  Some plants, however, do regulate their temperature more strictly. Some are merely thermogenic, ie. generating more internal heat than would otherwise be expected, but others display proper thermoregulation. The lotus plant is one example, maintaining its flowers at a temperature of 30-35C.  Because respiration is generally slower in plants than animals, just burning sugars for energy isn't a great way for them to generate a lot of heat. Instead, they can use alternative oxidase (AOX) and/or uncoupling proteins (UCP).  AOX just oxidizes substrates in the mitochondrial membrane without transferring the electrons to oxygen, thus uncoupling from the usual generation of ATP.  UCPs allow protons to leak back through the mitochondrial membrane, wasting some of the concentration gradient built up in respiration and instead just generating heat. UCPs are made in animals too, to varying extents, and chemical uncouplers exist too - dinitrophenol (DNP) is a notorious example, people have attempted to use it for weight loss (which is quite dangerous).  As for how plants sense temperature (a necessary prerequisite to regulation of temperature), that's a bigger topic because all plants do this; they react to temperature cues to know when to flower, when to protect themselves from elevated temperatures, and lots of other things. This review goes through various thermosensory mechanisms employed by plants."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What caused the earth’s rotation and what dictated the rate at which it spins? Have we lost any speed over the billions of years? My son asked my a perplexing question regarding earth and why it actually spins. I didn’t have a 100% grasp on the subject so I gave him the “I dunno buddy,” answer. I’m familiar with the Big Bang, but were all planets, suns, stars created at this one event? Did the order of chaos (planets collided/were destroyed and what we see is the aftermath) create our solar system to revolve around the sun in the same direction? Did the same Big Bang that made these enormous rocks also cause them to spin while being yanked into ellipses around a large grav source?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The Earth's spin rate is appreciably higher than what would be dictated by it simply forming from accretion. And its axial tilt is kind of cockeyed as well,.   The most plausible explanation is the hypothesis that a Mars-sized planet (which they named Theia) smacked us at a particular velocity/angle/location around 4 1/2B years ago--most likely twice, a few hundred thousand years apart.   The Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact\\_hypothesis includes the technical links needed to explore this more deeply. As far as I know this is the only hypothesis that can account for the current state of affairs of Earth and the Moon in our solar system.  What's truly fascinating to speculate about is the possibility that we wouldn't be here if Theia hadn't paid that fateful visit back in the day. One study proposes that the volatiles needed to form life were produced by Theia's impact:  https://www.universetoday.com/141342/without-the-impact-that-formed-the-moon-we-might-not-have-life-on-earth/  And our remarkably large Moon (relative to Earth) formed by this impact stabilizes Earth on its polar axis. Otherwise Earth's axial wobble would be much greater.   And Theia's iron core merged with ours, giving us a stronger Van Allen belt, which prevents the surface of the Earth from being bombarded by anywhere near as much radiation as would be the case otherwise.   We don't know if the amped-up Van Allen Belt and the \"gift of the volatiles\" and the faster rotation and the Moon-induced larger tides contributed to making Earth more favorable to life beginning here, but it seems plausible. And if all that is true--if life couldn't have started without our remarkably mild planetary climate and other conditions--then we could be alone in our galaxy.   As I said, this is all speculation piled on speculation, but it all does wrap around proven facts that are otherwise hard to arrive at."

Whenever a person \"randomly\" thinks of a number, they actually follow a deterministic process which necessarily must involve reducing the infinite set down to a finite set.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does dopamine and other \"feel good\" chemicals actually feel good? Why is our brain happy when it experiences these chemicals?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Dopamine is not really a \"feel-good chemical\". Opioids, endocannbinoids, and GABA fit that description better. Dopamine is used in the brain to help you exploit the resources in your environment. It does this by coding for reward expectations (\"I expect a small reward for opening the fridge\"). When an event deviates from baseline expectations (for better or for worse) dopamine responds strongly, in order to update your expectations. It thus acts as an indicator of progress. If you prevented dopamine signals from occurring in a rat, it wouldn't be motivated to seek out an available source of food. But if you put the food in its mouth, it would happily eat it.  If you want to get all technical, then we could say that our brains are (probably) Bayesian and that they are trying to avoid unexpected states by building mental models and making predictions about the future so they won't be surprised. Surprise, in this case, is bad. It means something is beyond your control. Things being beyond your control is dangerous. Dopamine is used to predict outcomes so that you will have an edge.  So the reason why some things \"feel good\" is that you are evolutionarily incentivized to exploit the resources of your environment. When something registers as such, it's going to feel good.  You are roaming around the world improving your mental model of your surroundings with the biologically prepared goal of extracting rewards and avoiding terrors and to hopefully create a copy of yourself who can do the same.  \"Feel-good chemicals\" are steering you toward desirable states."

Fluid intelligence is one half of a theory of intelligence put forward in the 60s which posited that general intelligence can be reduced into two subcategories: fluid intelligence which is the ability to solve novel problems and crystalized intelligence which is the capacity to store and execute known solutions to a problem.

I am an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the founding director of the Healthy Buildings Program. I also have a new book, out last month: *Healthy Buildings*. In March 2020, I became co-chair of the International Well Building Institute’s Coronavirus Task Force.  For several years in private industry before joining the faculty at Harvard, I led teams of scientists and engineers investigating, and resolving, hundreds of indoor environmental quality issues, from'sick buildings' to cancer clusters to all types of chemical/radiological/biological hazards. I learned two important facts: 1) too often we are responding to issues after there is a problem, and 2) we cannot solve these problems without a multidisciplinary approach. I have an interest in the dynamic interplay between the indoor environment and health and am continuing this line of research at Harvard, with a focus on optimizing indoor environments for health benefits. A natural extension of my research on buildings and the indoor environment is the consideration of the products we use in those environments, and how those influence our exposure and health.  I believe that we have to force a collision between these two disciplines: building science and health science. The indoor built environment (homes, offices, schools, hospitals, airplanes, laboratories) plays a critical role in our overall health, both due to the amount of time we spend indoors (~90%) and the ability of the buildings to positively and negatively influence our exposure. The goal is to improve the health of all people, in all buildings, everywhere, every day.  The pandemic spawned by the novel coronavirus has given us a heightened awareness of the role our buildings play in our health and wellbeing. I'm on the record back in early February advocating for healthy buildings strategies, like air filtration and increased ventilation, to reduce the spread of the virus indoors. Since then, I've written several articles about what we can do to reduce our exposure to the virus, including in grocery stores, public parks, and cars/ride shares.

The proper-time age of the universe can be inferred from observations in many ways. Ideally these ways would all produce the same result. That's not currently the case for big-bang cosmology! This discrepancy is kind of a big deal and is known as *The Hubble Tension*, and the *Crisis in Cosmology*  To determine the *Hubble Constant* (the physical constant that determines the proportionality relationship between speed and distance for all sufficiently distant astronomical bodies) we use 2 broad categories of methods: Early Universe and Late Universe methods.   Early Universe methods depend heavily on ΛCDM or other models, plus observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. Essentially deducing the Hubble Constant by the temperature of the CMB and how quickly one would expect it to cool using the ΛCDM model.  Late Universe methods use observed redshift (basically relative velocity) and various inferred distance measurements known as the Cosmic Distance Ladder.  Both of these methods should agree, and at first they did albeit with large error bars. However Over time, as more observations have been made with more sensitive instruments... They diverged! Now we have this inconsistency in our independent results, and therefore a serious inconsistency in our prediction of the proper-time age of the universe.  The options to resolve this inconsistency boil down to trying to explain why our distance measurements from the cosmic distance ladder are off, or why ΛCDM is wrong, or at least incomplete as a model. Multiple teams have tried to poke holes in different rungs of the ladder, with varying degrees of success, but recently a new bit of data analysis from some JWST data appears to confirm an earlier Hubble result for the first rung of the ladder.  TL;DR It's not certain and different ways of measuring it give different answers. This is a legitimate problem and has been called a crisis in cosmology!

(However, another friend, who is hovering near the black hole, disagrees and says it's definitely bluish.)  Warning: Do not try these experiments at home.  It's not realistic to expect to hover that close to a black hole; and with the distances involved, your friends might have a very long wait.  As the light approaches the black hole, it becomes blue-shifted (increased in frequency, i.e. decreased in wavelength) and then as it moves away  again from the black hole after going past it, it becomes red-shifted (decreased frequency, increased wavelength). If the distances are the same, these two effects cancel out, leaving the light looking the way it did when it started.  Edit: The light would also change direction as it passes the black hole, its path bent by the gravitational field, so it's best if the black hole is placed not midway between the friends but off to one side.  You shine your flashlight in the general direction of the black hole, and some of the light bends around at just the angle needed to end up going towards your friend."

    "golden_answer": " In fact this is how infrared light was first discovered.   >Herschel directed sunlight through a glass prism to create a spectrum - the \"rainbow\" created when light is divided into its colors - and measured the temperature of each color. He used three thermometers with blackened bulbs (to better absorb the heat) and placed one bulb in each color while the other two were placed beyond the spectrum as control samples. As he measured the temperatures of the violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red light, he noticed that all of the colors had temperatures higher than the controls and that the temperature of the colors increased from the violet to the red part of the spectrum. After noticing this pattern, Herschel decided to measure the temperature just beyond the red portion of the spectrum in a region apparently devoid of sunlight. To his surprise, he found that this region had the highest temperature of all.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: This may be a dumb question, but when I turn off my lights, where does all the light go? Does it get absorbed into matter? It does it just disappear into nothingness?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " This is far from a dumb question, it's actually a very good question. Light is a form of energy, but when you turn the light off, the light goes away, so where does the energy go?  The short answer is: it gets absorbed by the wall as heat.  The longer answer needs a bit of a more detailed mental picture. The wall is a solid, which consists of a (fairly) regular structure of atoms. Just imagine a grid of hard spheres laying against each other. This is the surface of the wall. At absolute zero, these atoms do not move and are simply at rest, one just touching the next. Having a temperature means that the wall contains ~~heat~~ *thermal energy*. This ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* is a random motion of the atoms around their equilibrium point, they're basically vibrating. Such a vibration can travel rather far through the lattice in the form of a wave. One ball pushes the next, which pushes the next, which pushes ... etc. Such a wave is commonly called a 'phonon', because it is also the way in which sound can move through solids.  Now think of the light. Light consists of tiny particles called photons, not to be confused with the phonons in the wall. Each photon is a tiny packet of electromagnetic energy and momentum. If such a photon hits (an atom of) the wall, its energy and momentum is absorbed. Since both these quantities need to be conserved, it means the atom will get a little \"kick\" from absorbing the photon. It will move, and kick against its neighbor, etc etc. So basically the photon has been converted into a phonon.  If enough photons get absorbed, this will result in the wall warming up slightly. So the light gets converted into ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* in the wall.  It's rather analogous to a stone falling into a lake. The energy of the stone will spread out over the surface of the water in the form of waves. The water itself doesn't move much, but the waves can carry the energy quite far. Likewise, the atoms don't move much, but the energy/momentum from the photons can carry rather deep into the wall."

A heart program transplanted everyone on its heart list except the sensitized patients and I've lost track of how many renal transplants the other center has done.  To put things in terms of numbers in September of 2019 I received an average of 10 organ offers a day when I worked.  In September of 2020 I received an average of 21 organ offers a day.    I would do a thoracic transplant (heart or lungs) once in every three to five shifts in 2019.  Since June of 2020 I do a thoracic transplant probably about 3 out of every 4 shifts.    Renal transplants happened about once in every three shifts before, we do a renal transplant almost every day now, sometimes we do two.   I've spoken to friends that work at 2 OPOs.  One I used to work for and they did about 200 donors a year and their goal for this year was 208.  By the first week in October they had already done 240 and were on track to do 300.   The other's goal was 190 and they did 294 donors this year.  We had a very big dip in donation in March.  For a couple of weeks there were almost no transplants that happened.  Things were slow in April too but got back to normal in May and then exploded in June and just kept going.  We had another two \"slow\" weeks around the end of October beginning of November when things were only a little increased over previous years, but other than that it has been non-stop.  I work about 280-310 hours a month now.  Last week I worked 96 hours.   I actually looked at the total number of offers for the whole of 2020, including the normal first couple of months and the severe drop for about a month and a half going to the end of September and we had an increase of 7% in the number of organ offers over 2019.  I'd imagine that increase was greater by the end of the year but I haven't had the time to actually do the math yet."

Things like gestation periods, how the body reacts to pregnancies, the way the pregnancy itself progresses - is there anything that has changed over time, even perhaps between now and a couple centuries ago?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Chimps and gorillas have a gestational period just under humans which implies that ~9 months was a commonality likely shared with early hominids.  As has been mentioned in order to stand upright our pelvis has rotated and shortened to accommodate the range of motion needed in our legs as well as narrowing which better supports our weight. This is the reason childbirth is such a problem for us, female pelvises being unfused so that they can flex in labour and baby's skull plates unfused so that they can move and squish a bit. When compared even to our closest great ape cousins we are born spectacularly immature and under developed, some say that's an advantage because we have more time to learn which is uncertain. But for sure we would be unable to walk upright without it or major changes in reproduction.  So it's probably fair to assume that with the trend from quadraped to biped follows difficulty in labour and premature young.  More recently we know that several other subspecies of homosapiens interbred, including Neanderthal and Denisovan man as we can still find remnants of Thier DNA in the current Human population. So it's reasonable to assume that they had nearly identical reproductive habits to us although we don't KNOW.  One of the big issues with studying this field is a real lack of data, we can study our own genetics and discover our familial links with sub species of homo but this was still relatively recently. Fossilisation being a rare process anyway we do not have complete fossil records of all hominids and homo though all stages of development. Enough to comfortably decuce common ancestry but lacking the detail to easily study subtle changes in how young develop and are born.  Even after the consolidation of homosapiens sapiens from earlier sub species our earliest written languages are only a few thousand years old and aren't detailed records of pregnancy and childbirth. This how much ideas about it have changed since then and vary even now around the globe. We can be fairly sure that pregnancy had a higher mortality rate and infant deaths were higher but how high they were we don't know."

    "golden_answer": " Because the sail itself can generate lift. What makes it even more interesting is that you do this while moving toward the direction of wind, not away from it ( at an angle up to 15 degrees to the wind, but usually around 45 degrees ).  http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/graphics/velocites.GIF  This drawing explains it quite nicely. The shape of the sail redirects the air from the wind which creates a force acted on the sail normal ( 90 degrees ) to the angle of the sail.  Also important to consider is apparent wind. Apparent wind is actual wind + wind you feel because you are moving. If you are moving with the wind, the faster you move, the less apparent wind you ( and the sails ) feel and when you reach windspeed ( if you could ) there is no force on the sails ( you move 10mph forward, wind blows 10mph from behind, you feel 0 wind ). But if you are moving toward the wind, the faster you get the more apparent wind you feel, giving you even more force on the sail, until the drag on the water and air is higher than the speed you are gaining which is then the max velocity you can travel at."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How close would you have to get to the sun for the vacuum of space to be at room temperature?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The vacuum of space does not have a temperature, temperature is a property that materials have. For example, it's commonly said that deep space has a temperature of about 2.7 K, but that's misleading. 2.7 K is the equilibrium temperature that an ideal blackbody would reach in deep space due to cosmic microwave background radiation.  So a better question would be, how close would you have to get to the sun for an ideal black body to be at room temperature? Spoiler alert: close to where the earth is. The answer is found by balancing incoming solar radiation with the outgoing blackbody radiation of the object, a common problem in introductory thermo classes. The derivation here, usually used to find the temperature of a hypothetical planet at a given distance, can be rearranged to solve for distance when given temperature, and the result is about 84 million miles, or 0.9 AU. This assumes the body is spherical, but an arbitrary shape would reach a similar temperature.  The difference between our hypothetical blackbody and the earth comes down to albedo (reflection), emissivity, and various greenhouse effects; if the earth were a perfect blackbody it would be about ~~40~~ 10 °C colder.  Edit: note, this only applies to something that isn't producing its own heat like a person or anything electronic. Any internal heat production means the body has to radiate more heat to reach equilibrium, resulting in a higher temperature. Additionally, it's hard to say how a person would *perceive* temperature in the vacuum of space (before dying, of course) since our perception of temperature is largely dependent on heat transfer and not necessarily absolute temperature."

    "golden_answer": " Actually, we do.  They just aren't as common as light emitting diodes.  For near infrared, there's one or more infrared LEDs in every  every television remote.   Far infraed (sometimes called THz waves) require specialized diodes to create and amplify, and the process is very inefficient (so far - they're working on it because the uses are mind-bending).  For microwaves, there's a kind of diode called a Gunn diode that has a crazy thing called negative resistance coefficient causing plasma instability; bias it right, stick it in a waveguide, and the Gunn diode turns DC into microwaves in one step.  You'll find them in police speed radars and automatic door openers in grocery stores.    Radio waves \\*are\\* microwaves, just big ones -- the issue is that to be an efficient transmitter, your antenna needs to be at least half a wavelength long.  AM radio has a wavelength of roughly one football (or soccer, or rugby) field long, so the diode implementation is rediculously large, and other methods are used.  X-rays and Gamma rays also overlap; the difference was taught to me by a professor who worked on the Manhattan project \"If you turn the power off and they go away, it's X-rays.  If they keep getting emitted, it's gammas:.\"  Now, X-rays can be emitted in a process called X-ray fluorescence; that's how the \"alloy identifying guns\" used in scrapyards work to sort out scrap metals into different types - they slam the scrap metal with a blast of gamma rays, and look at the X-ray frequencies (yes, X-rays have \"color\", or something quite close to it).  If it shines in the \"color\" of chromium, it's almost certainly stainless steel; the \"colors\" of tungsten means tool steel, and so on.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why is 18 the maximum amount of electrons an atomic shell can hold?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " >Why is 18 the maximum amount of electrons an atomic shell can hold?  It's not.  18 is the maximum amount of electrons that the *third* shell can hold.  Other shells have different maxima:  the first shell can only hold 2 electrons; the second shell can hold 8, the third can hold 18, the fourth can hold 32, and so on.  Each shell can hold 2n^(2) electrons.  This formula arises because electrons are fermions (particles with half-integer spin) and fermions are required to occupy distinct quantum states.  Electrons in atoms have four separate quantum numbers that can take different integer values, with the allowed ranges of some quantum numbers determined by the value of others.  For example, the principle quantum number n denotes the shell number -- it starts at 1, counting up from there until that shell is filled with electrons; once it is full, additional electrons occupy the next shell with n=2, and so on.  The azimuthal quantum number l (lowercase L) starts at 0 and increases up to a maximum of n-1 ... so when n=1, then l=0, but when n=2, l can have a value of either 0 or 1, and when n=3 then l can have a value of 0, 1, or 2.  Then there's the magnetic quantum number m which has the same range as l except it can also take on negative values.  So at n=2, m can be any of -1, 0, and 1.  And at n=3, m can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.  And finally, for every unique pair of n, l, and m, each electron also has a spin projection of either +1/2 or -1/2 depending on whether it is spin-up or spin-down.  So then, the first electron must have (n=1, l=0, m=0) and either possible value of s, and the second electron must have the same numbers but the opposite-signed value of s.  Then the first shell is filled.  The third and fourth electrons will have (n=2, l=0, m=0), the fifth and sixth will have (n=2, l=1, m=0), the seventh and eigth (n=2, l=1, m=1), ninth and tenth (n=2, l=1, m=-1), and then the second shell is filled, and so on.

    "golden_answer": " Animals are more likely to be born with heterochromia if they have the gene for white fur. Cats just happen to be more likely to possess that gene.    Heterochromia in cats starts when they are kittens. Kittens are born with blue eyes and their true eye colour only begins to show at around 7 to 12 weeks old when the amount of melanin in their eyes begins to change. When an adult cat has blue eyes it means there's an absence of melanin.  The gene that creates white fur stops the melanin from being able to reach one of the eyes during the kitten’s development. In cats who have heterochromia, the melanin doesn’t spread fully through one eye which leaves it partially blue.  As someone else pointed out, Huskies and Australian Shepherds also commonly have heterochromia. Why? Because those are two dog breeds that often have the gene for white fur."

    "golden_answer": " Basically, there's a part of your brain that is the respiratory rhythm generator - its called the pre-botzinger complex.  It's located in the ventrolateral medulla in the respiratory control center of the medulla, close to other structures like the retrotrapezoid nucleus and brains \"integration center\" called the nucleus tractus solitarius.    For breathing you aren't paying attention to, this is where your breathing generally starts - respiratory rhythm generated by the pre-BotzC.  The Pre-BotzC projects to primarily the inspiratory muscles (ie diaphragm).  You can think of the motor cortex projecting to the same motor neurons, but downstream of where the Pre-BotzC does.  So, signal from the motor cortex can \"override\" the signal from the pre-BotzC, which is what allows us to pause our breath to speak or shout, things like that.

Treatments of cancer can also affect weight: - chemotherapy can cause horrendous nausea and vomiting but can also strip away the lining of the bowel, causing inadequate absorption of your food.  - chemotherapy is also very metabolically demanding; by essentially damaging cells throughout the body (hence why hair falls out), the body is forced to replenish them, those using energy - radiation treatments of the mouth, throat and chest can cause burns and scarring of the oesophagus and make it difficult or even uncomfortable to eat - plus surgeries etc are hugely demanding, not including bowel surgery affecting ingestion and absorption of food!!  Hope that helps."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is a solid just a liquid with really high viscosity? Title. If a liquid achieves a high enough viscosity, does it start being considered a solid?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In general, no. A fluid with high viscosity will deform continuously under even an infinitesimally small amount of force over sufficient time. A solid won't.  There are composite materials, such as gels, which blur the lines, but only because they're more than one material linked together.  Lots of solids can be *fluidized*, like sand, but these are composite, as there are gaps, and therefore air, making them act as composite materials again.  The only way a solid can be a liquid with high viscosity is if you accept that at some point, that viscosity is permitted to effectively be infinite or permit the material to crack or deform.  But that's just it: the very definition of solid precludes that it cannot be a liquid or a gas. Period."

So light travels at 299,792 kilometers per second through vacuum and at \\~200,000 kilometers per second through air. That's almost 100,000 kmps slower, what's the slowest that light can travel through a material and what material?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In principle: Yes. Light has been slowed to below 10 m/s.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetically_induced_transparency  I don't have time right now, might write more about it later.  Edit: The key here is the introduction in the section \"Slow light and stopped light\". Make the absorption depend critically on tiny frequency changes (kHz range) and you get very slow group velocities for a narrow wavelength range."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If two power plants feed AC voltage/current into the same electricity grid, how do we make sure they are in the same phase to not cancel out each other? If two power generators feed a sinusoidal voltage into the grid, but one has a phase difference of 180° to the other, wouldn't the voltages cancel each other out?    So after the voltage of the power plant is transformed into the appropriate voltage, how do we make sure the voltages have appropriate phase differences? Or does it not make any difference what phase the feeded voltage of each power plant is?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Senior reactor operator here.   Prior to connecting any generator to a bus, you need to match phase, frequency, and voltage.   Most nuclear plants still do this manually, newer plants use automatic synchronization circuits.   What we will do is turn on the synch scope. The scope is connected to the bus and the generator, and the resulting out of phase voltages cause the scope to move forward or backward. The scope is round with a needle, like a clock. When the arrow is facing straight up, that means both sources are in phase.   So how we will synchronize the generator, is after the synch scope is on, we check the voltage difference on a meter, and adjust generator voltage to match grid voltage.   Once voltage is matched, we adjust the turbine/generator governor to adjust frequency. We aim to have the synch scope rotating slowly in the clockwise direction. 1 rpm on the scope or less for a large generator. When the scope rotates clockwise, it means we are slightly ahead of grid frequency, and at less than 1 rpm, we are very close to grid frequency. Then we wait until the needle is about straight up (at the 12 o'clock position) where phase is matched. At this point we will close the generator output breaker.   Once the breaker closes, for the power grid, phase voltage and frequency of the generator will all lock onto grid voltage. The fact that we were slightly faster than the grid means that once we synchronize, we will be putting real power out onto the grid. (If we were slower, the grid would be reverse powering the generator and it would trip).   At this point we will raise governor settings up to put load on the grid and close our steam dumps, while also gaining margin to our reverse power trip. Finally we adjust the voltage regulator to set reactive power and bus voltage where the transmission operators want it.   If you have any questions let me know. I'll see if I can get a video of this in the next day or two from our simulator."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If skin from one area of the body is used to repair a wound elsewhere, what happens to the area where the skin was taken from? Sorry for the confusing wording, but I was just reading about a man who had skin cancer removed from his back, and skin from his thigh was used to repair the area on his back. Which made me wonder, then what happens to his thigh? Doesn’t that just leave a similar wound in a different place?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Surgeon here. “Split thickness skin grafts” are partial thickness slices of your skin. The donor site will heal the skin because there is still a partial layer of skin left behind that includes hair follicles and sweat glands, which is where new skin cells come from.  “Full thickness skin grafts” are what they sound like: full thickness. The skin cannot heal upwards from the bottom and would need to heal inwards from the sides. So when surgeons take full thickness skin, they suture the wound edges together. Then it heals like any surgical incision or cut you get.  Split thickness is more common because you can take very large grafts and the skin will heal. You can’t take large full thickness grafts because you wouldn’t be able to sew the edges together with a wound so large. Also full thickness skin grafts have a more difficult time “taking.”  You may be asking regarding split thickness skin grafts: why make a new wound just to cover an existing wound? Because the kinds of existing wound we do this for won’t heal well by itself. If you put a skin graft on it, the existing wound will heal well, and the new wound will heal well.  Edit: since a lot of people are mentioning meshing I thought I’d add a blurb about it too. We often mesh split thickness skin grafts. This serves two purposes: 1) the graft can cover a larger surface area, and 2) fluid that would otherwise build up under the skin graft has a place to escape. If that fluid stayed there the graft would not stick and it would die. Meshing the graft does cause more scarring and contracture when it heals, and so it’s not well suited for cosmetic areas like the face or mobile joints like the hand. If we don’t mesh the graft I have to stick a syringe in it every so often to suck out the fluid that builds up underneath."

    "golden_answer": " No, they won't. However, they do act in a way that can be accounted for. It's been a while, but the Reynold's number (which deals with the viscosity of the fluid) and the Mach number (which deals with the speed of the fluid) are both quantities that can be easily determined, and so a model can be made that accounts for the fact that these do not scale linearly.  It was actually a fascinating topic to learn about, and I'm sorry I don't remember it better"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: There are scientific freezers on the market that can reach temperatures of -86° Celsius. If I put a water bottle in it, how long would it take to freeze?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Let's make some simplifying assumptions and try some proportional reasoning to compare it to a normal freezer (-20 °C).  Assumptions: We use the same water bottle in both freezers, we ignore convection, the water bottle contains pure water at 21 °C, the freezers are made of the same material and are able to maintain their temperatures perfectly, we have a nucleation site for the crystals, and \"frozen\" just means all the water has turned solid. This is a lot of assumptions, but it could give us a rough estimate.  **Conduction:** Conductive heat transfer is directly proportional to the absolute difference in temperature between the objects. In the normal freezer, we have a 41 Kelvin difference, while in the scientific one, we have a 107 Kelvin difference. This means that the scientific fridge will **initially conduct heat at a rate 2.6 times faster**, and, at **0°C, will conduct heat 4.3 times faster** than the normal fridge. We'll see why that's important in a second.  **Radiation:** Radiative heat transfer is proportional to the 4th power of absolute temperature, but it works both ways, so net radiative heat transfer is proportional to the difference in the 4th powers of the absolute temperatures. 21°C = 294 K, 0°C = 273 K, -20 °C = 253 K, and -86°C = 187 K.   The math here is a little funky but (294\\^4 - 187\\^4)/(294\\^4 - 253\\^4) = 1.85, **so the initial rate of heat transfer will be 1.85 times faster** for the science freezer. A similar calculation with 273 K as the starting temperature means that the rate of heat transfer is going to be **2.94 times faster at 0°C.**  So why is 0°C so important? The latent heat of fusion of water is about 80 times greater than the specific heat of liquid water, so freezing one gram of water takes the same amount of energy as reducing the temperature of a gram of liquid water by 80°C. Since we assumed a 21°C starting temperature, about 4/5 of the energy will be released by the state change of the water, which will occur at a temperature of 0°C.   So in this extremely simplified scenario, **the water bottle will probably freeze about 3 times faster in the scientific freezer, but it could freeze 4 times faster if conduction is the dominant form of energy transfer.** Again, I ignored all convection and other effects such as the insulating effect of the air bubbles that would form in the ice and the gradient of temperature across the bottle."

    "golden_answer": " A few things 1) less people dying of other things before they can get cancer - the longer you live, the more time you have to accumulate mutations that can lead to cancer and the less good your cells are at repairing them 2) we're better at spotting it.  Lots of small, easily treated tumours get found early that contribute to the number of cancer cases reported but would have never been found before the technology got good.  They might not ever have developed into something dangerous  but we spot them and count them anyway."

The amygdala is the emotion or fear center of the brain and hyperresponsive in PTSD. Because of that, I've been very interested in the region and its role in stress and trauma. In 2020, my team and I studied two patients with epilepsy who also had PTSD characterized by heightened fear responses to things that reminded them of their trauma. Post surgery that targeted the right amygdala, both the patients no longer suffered from PTSD.  In July 2022 my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication has helped organize this AMA session. I'll be available at 1pm ET (17 UT).
