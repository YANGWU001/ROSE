    "golden_answer": " I always say it is the best job in the world that I would never recommend to anyone who can imagine doing ANYTHING else.    The highs are super high and the lows are super low.  But you only asked about the lows so ...   Financial stress is the most important, IMO.  You will be in huge debt with relatively low starting salary and not a huge amount of room for increasing salary unless you own, specialize, or work ER.   Paying 1500 a month for 15+ years is a black hole of frustration. Esp when your salary is around 70k (maybe less).   Every single day there is the stress of managing cases that you could help but owners limit you due to finances, belief systems, etc ...  Giving your patients/clients all you have and the pet dies anyway ...  Being called horrible names because you charge for your services ...  Calling the police because a client has threatened you or your staff ...  Struggling in your marriage because you work long hours and weekends so you miss many dinners, parties, and important events ...  Struggling in your marriage and friendships because your work drains you emotionally so you tend to shut down outside the office ...  There are good bosses but if you have a shitty one there is nothing to do besides leaving and finding another job and trying not to burn any bridges bc the veterinary community is small and reputation is HUGE ...  There is virtually NO oversight to ensure your colleagues practice appropriate medicine and seeing what some \"professionals\" do can be sickening ... (I'm looking at you, Dr Pol)  Finding a job is getting harder and harder each year because schools are cranking out huge numbers of graduates and more vet schools are being built/accredited despite an oversupply of veterinarians in the vast majority of communities. This drives salaries even lower ...   Veterinarians have a very high suicide rate by profession.   :(    Edit : two words"

It is my first time through this and it is heartbreaking. Even more, so because I have to make a long journey to, a clinic, and then back.   It made me wonder why, in this modern age, there was no option to do it myself.   All the more curious because, I raise chickens (for meat and eggs), and in the past have raised pigs and cattle. It is confusing that I am allowed to humanely process my own meat, but there isn't an option for me to humanely say goodbye to a loving pet.   In my state, we can even humanely provide suicide to a loved human who is near death.  I AM NOT asking how to do it. Nor do I suggest everyone should do it. I am simply wondering why we haven't evolved to offering this choice?  Thank you.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " As others have said, there are veterinarians who perform house calls for euthanasia. This may be difficult to arrange at the moment due to COVID.   To answer your question about why euthanasias are only done by veterinarians in this case, it has to do with our current standards of practice for companion animal medicine (pets rather than farm animals or wildlife). The AVMA, which is the national regulatory veterinary body, puts forth specific guidelines for euthanasia to be performed ethically and humanely. The focus for us as vets is to minimize any pain or suffering felt by the animal during the procedure. Most vets in the states use an overdose of an anesthetic drug to achieve this. These drugs are strictly controlled by the DEA and thus cannot be dispensed out for use by a client as such.   I’m sorry that you’re going through the loss of a fur baby. Cancer sucks 😢. Wishing you the best.  Edit: spelling"

This is our first dog, but he seems to be behaving rather normally by our standards.   Unfortunately, we believe that he may be experiencing some vision problems. He seems to squint and have a trouble noticing us until we make a loud sound (at first we initially passed this off as him just being an inattentive puppy). He likes to follow, but can often trot off in the wrong direction and lose track of us. He also seems to never chase tennis balls when thrown inside, but will run frenziedly towards the frisbee when it claps loudly against the hard floor.   Today, I tried the menace reflex test several times, and received no blink whatsoever.   If it helps, attached here are close-ups of his eyes. His pupils look a bit odd, but hopefully they're alright.  What should I do?

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Going to take my beagle for a hospital stay for a brain infection and want to know if I am doing the right thing. Rosie is a 10 year old beagle who has been dealing with chronic otitis since November. The infection has spread to inner ears and gotten into the brain. We’ve had a CT done and at first was recommended TECA. But now that she’s been having seizures they don’t want to operate until they see if the infection in the brain can be treated with IV antibiotics during a hospital stay with monitoring from a neurologist. After that we would talk surgery to remove the infection but we aren’t there yet. She’s been comfortable at home. Continues to eat and drink and go to the bathroom with no trouble. Walks around sniffing everything is sight as normal lately which is a big improvement from her being completely lethargic. She is on zonisamide for the seizures and Baytril for the ear infections. Has recently had cytology done to confirm Baytril is the correct med for her. Me and my wife are just beside ourselves right now thinking we had a fairly treatable issue and no things are more guarded. They did recommend and MRI but financially we can only afford the hospital stay and future surgery but the addition of the MRI just puts it to a level that we just cannot afford. We are bringing her in on Monday since the neurologist didn’t see a reason that it had to be done today, plus they aren’t in the office on weekends to be able to monitor her. I just want to make sure we are doing the right thing. Even though our GP and the specialist clinic both agree we are doing everything possible. It just feels like I am failing my best friend.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " To start, I'm not a veterinary neurologist and I've never treated a dog with otitis interna that's spread from the middle/inner ear to the brain.    However... I'm a veterinary anesthesiologist (10 years) that supervises a veterinary MRI center (4 years), and I have seen a number of dogs that have presented for imaging for near-comatose states, are diagnosed with a brain infection from inner ear disease, have surgery and treatment are have made REMARKABLE recoveries, to the point that they are nearly normal dogs.  It is beyond shocking to me that a patient that cannot even swallow, never mind walk, can be respond so quickly.   To be fair, we see patients that don't respond that well too, so I don't want to mislead you that an MRI or surgery is a guaranteed cure.   It sounds like your approach is a good one.  From your description your pup is improving on Bayril and Zoni, and that's a great thing.  I'm not saying that you have to pursue surgery if she is improving.  Step-wise treatment plans are generally wise ones.  If you don't want surgery, or to be very honest couldn't afford it, that's perfectly OK.  There are things I have diagnosed that I wouldn't pursue treatment on my own pet, even though I recommend it.  We always offer the best possible treatment option first.  But if that's not possible for ANY reason (and I promise 99.9% of vets won't EVER judge you for the reason), that's your decision and it's ok.  Many families can't afford a CT, or to see a specialist.  Give yourself credit for doing all that you've done for her, and don't 'should' on yourself and blame yourself for what your hearts and brains tell you to do.    I hope that she continues to do well and improve.  It sounds like you have a good team, and partnership in her care.  Best to you and your family.  - Dr. E.J."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: The vet said my dog is going to die tonight. Just a little back story, I rescued my Male pit bull from animal services 6 years ago when he was approximately 3 years old. He was found on the street positive with heart worms, he was treated after I adopted him and made a full recovery from that.   About 5 months ago He developed a fatty ball on his belly button just above his penis. Probably the size of half an orange fruit. Very squishy and he didn’t seem to be bothered when I touch it .  2 days ago he started acting a little weird as in not eating as much when typically he finishes his whole bowl.   Yesterday he through up what looked like, brown almost digested food.  On our walk this afternoon I noticed he was bloated and then I checked his belly and the fatty bump was gone. There was probably a little tiny bit of fatty lump the size of a dime that was left. He wasn’t acting normal either. Decided to take him directly to the vet.  Finally they call me in to the room to be seen after waiting an hour.   The vet came in and saw my dog laying on the floor and the first thing he said was how he could tell immediately my dog is very sick. Vet checked his mouth, very pale. Vet Explained his blood is not traveling. Vet checked poop, looks fine. I did tell the vet about the lump. After one abdominal X-ray the vet immediately knew something was wrong. Took me back to explain the Xray. There’s a mas and fluid pushing his organs. The vet thinks it’s terminal cancer. Vet said it could be liver, not really sure. This vet is very blunt and has been around for a very long time. Vet was explaining that we would need to find out what’s killing him. Recommended a ultra sound but also stated we wouldn’t really know unless they went in with surgery. I also want to mention after the vet checked his blood he seemed like he was blown away at how normal it was. The vet had mentioned anemia killing him but once he looked at the blood he dropped that possible diagnoses. This vet visit was pretty much all over the place and very emotional for me.   Ending diagnosis was a mas in his abdomen bleeding and fluid in his abdomen.  DR left me with a choice to put my dog down which he recommended or to take My dog home and he will die at home tonight. And the vet mentioned my dog will slip into a coma state.   I asked the vet if he was in pain, he said no. decided to take my dog home. The doctor didn’t want to give him medication or even stick a needle to drain anything as he didn’t want to worsen the situation.   Also before we left the vet did ask if he got into any toxic things or medication as it causes things like this. My dog isn’t really known to eat anything that isn’t food. He’s very well behaved.    I thought about this whole experience alot and it seems like what it’s coming down to is $$ to be able to diagnose properly. So I called around to get an ultrasound but since it’s night time no one is available even at emergency clinics.   The plan is to keep him alive through the night so we can atleast do an ultra sound to hopefully get a Diagnosis in the morning.   When we got home I cooked up 2 eggs for my dog and he ate them with no hesitation and also drank a good amount.  Despite him seeming weak and wanting to lay down he raises his head and gave kisses to my nephew who came over to see him.  This dog is loved by many and I do not want to give up on him easy just because he is a dog. I looked at my mom and told her putting him down wouldn’t be an option if this was a human child .  We’ve been through so much together and I can tell he is trying his hardest to hold on. It just sucks that I feel like money is meaning life or death for him.  I need some input on this situation. Not looking for a diagnosis either. I feel like I am not just being optimistic, I truly feel like there is hope. It doesn’t make sense. My dog was in good health before these last 2 days. Out of no where he just started deteriorating today.   Edit* my dog was neutered when I adopted him\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I will not comment on diagnosis, but please know, OP, that humane euthanasia is a kind and painless way to let your pet pass away. If the vet is recommending euthanasia, that is because they believe it is a viable option if further intensive care and/or diagnostics are not able to be pursued for any reason. The euthanasia process is, for the one experiencing it, a gentle way to cross the rainbow bridge.   If you have concerns about euthanasia, that is understandable, and feel free to ask here. Please know, however, the majority of veterinarians would advise that euthanasia is almost always a better option for a sick pet than passing unsupervised at home.   I am not familiar with the intimate details of this case, as I have not personally examined him. Due to that, I am not saying either way what I think about euthanasia for your dog in this instance. I simply want to emphasize that your doctor wants the best for your pup and has offered a humane option. If it ever comes to that point in the future, you can be at ease knowing that you did your boy a kindness. And if that happens, you can visit r/petloss for more support.   Thank you for loving and taking care of your pittie boy. They simply are the best. I sincerely hope the best for all of you.  ETA: u/Zealousideal_Tap_754 I want to clarify on my above qualifier \"for any reason\". What that means is that there are other reasons than financial hardship for which that option is given. There are cases where even advanced care and diagnostics are unable to avoid the inevitable route of death or euthanasia."

Again like what the others said, check the fine print and make sure the insurance will pay for things like surgeries, major and minor lnesses, dental extractions etc. Check what they will pay for pre-existing conditions like your dog's recurrent ear/eye infections. Most importantly, you want to think long term. The last thing you want is to not be able to afford the quality medicine and diagnostic you need because it costs several hundred or thousand dollars in the future since smaller breed dogs can live much longer than their larger counterparts.

He is neutered. There is also a 7 year old female Calico in the house that he mostly ignores, except for a daily grooming sessions & sharing naps in the sunlight. His medical history is virtually non existent, except for an extended stay at the vet after being neutered because the incision wouldn’t stop bleeding & then he got a secondary infection. Also, my ex would blow marijuana smoke in his face numerous times for a couple of years, without my knowledge of course.  The problem we’re having is that within the past 5 years his behavior has become extreme & annoying. He had to have 4-5 teeth pulled about 3 years ago, so we feed him wet food. But he cries for food all day. We have to feed him sometimes 5 x a day because he will not stop howling & following us until we do, & when we got to give him more wet food, we realize he’s barely eaten the previous serving of food. He likes the food, we’ve tried other brands & he won’t eat them at all. This brand he likes, but it’s almost like he forgets he still has food or he won’t eat but a few bites at a time & then it sits out for 30 minutes & he wants fresh fresh food? We can’t figure out a way to feed him so that he is satisfied & we get terrorized in the process. The other issue is that he howls *constantly*. He will go into a room in the house, get in a corner facing the wall & do this really deep howling meow repeatedly. It is literally driving us insane. He’s woken up our 18 month old twins multiple times. He has learned to stand outside their nursery & howl because we’ll definitely give him more food to avoid waking them up, although he does this unrelated to food as well. I don’t know if he has anxiety or behavioral issues or if he is unhappy, but let me repeat, he is literally driving us bonkers. He’s never been a chill cat. He was bouncing off the walls crazy as a kitten & young cat, then adulthood into senior years, even before the babies, he began acting this way with the howling & going crazy stalking us for more food constantly. He’s been to the vet in the past year for a general check up, although my husband didn’t mention any of this to the vet. Can anyone tell me what seems to be going on here?

He started last October with just not being his happy hungry self, so vet expressed his anal glands.  He continued to not eat much, appetite comes and goes.
