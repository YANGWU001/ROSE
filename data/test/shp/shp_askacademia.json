Seeing as I literally just finished my PhD annual review report my supervisors haven’t assigned much work in order to give me space to write the documents.

It’s not like I haven’t got things to  do it’s just that  the work I’m doing is mainly editing and running batches of code as well as some light theory/literature reading.  Does anyone else feel like they’re pressured to fill their days?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I think I understand what you're feeling. When I finished my PhD it took me \\*at least\\* 3 months to \"come down\" after the submission stress, working long hours, always feeling pressure to fill my days to ensure I had positive results (negative results were a big no-no) to show at weekly lab meetings. There's also pressure to finish the PhD in time so we can get on with our future (which is also uncertain). I think we work this way for so long (years for a PhD) that it becomes almost normal for us to function at this level of stress. Finding balance after it all has been a long, continuous journey that I still haven't quite mastered. I'm still an academic so I don't think I can fully recover from this pressure for productivity until I leave the ivory tower (a transition in progress). My advice is to take advantage of easier days, go out, get your life back. No one talks about the recovery needed after a PhD - give yourself time to adjust. This is \"normal\"."

Example: \"Last AB\", not \"Last ABC\"  However, I've read the \"instructions for authors\" of many journals, and none of them says anything about choosing the initials you want to use, you just have to put your full name and (I suppose) they abbreviate it by themselves.

I'm a high school senior and considering professorship in Economics or Psychology as a long-term-goal; what should I know? Academia seems like the perfect career for me, but I don't personally know any professors so I'd like to hear from Reddit. Thanks!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I'm gonna start off by saying that you are at *far* too early of a stage to be thinking about a professorship.  First off, just your undergrad is 4 years of your life which you haven't even begun. Assuming you graduate from that (Which a decent chunk do not), a large majority decide they are done with school and go in to the workforce.  Next, a Masters, and then a Ph.D (Which you need for a faculty (\"professor\") position) is another 6-8 years, and it's *very* tough. One could make the argument that you can tough your way through an undergrad - this is not true in grad school. Unless you know you want to do it, you're going to have a very hard time (And even then...). Pay isn't very good, and the hours are long. I never recommend anyone plan on grad school until they know they like what they're doing. Plenty decide to go into the industry after finishing their degree.  Then you have post docs, which is another 2-4+ years. The pay is a little better, but still not great. And then you apply for faculty positions, which are HIGHLY competitive. If you manage to get one, you're then contending with long hours, an insane amount of work/publishing schedule, tenure reviews, and god knows what else. By the time you get tenure, it's been another 10-15 years since your first post-doc, and even longer by the time you make full professor.  And all of this is assuming you clear every hurdle, which is no small feat. You may decide the life isn't for you, that you don't like school enough to do an advanced degree (or perhaps even finish your undergrad), or who knows what else. There's a LOT lying between you and being a professor right now, including a fair amount of luck.  My best recommendation would be to start your undergrad with the idea that you want to **consider** grad school. Focus on doing well in classes, and consider trying to get undergrad research opportunities if they are available. This will let you figure out if grad school/research is the life you want, and set you up to apply when you finish undergrad. Once you're in grad school, you can start thinking about where you want to go from there."

Research scholars or researchers put in more hours and accumulate greater experience. However, when it comes to wages, they are paid very low when compared to computer science graduates straight out of college. Can you explain this asymmetry?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Despite what people like to think, nobody is paid based on how smart they are or how much work they put in. They are paid based on 2 things:  - The amount of money they make for the person paying them  - The amount it costs to replace them (demand vs supply)  When academics produce very little that makes money, and are easily replaced due to the massive supply of other PhDs pining after the academic jobs with no self-respect, willing to be paid the bare minimum to survive, they will be paid very little."

    "golden_answer": " This is what I suggest.  Get into industry now, or get a master's and then industry.  Spend 2 years in industry to get real world experience and learn something about what you want to do. Do you want to go into biotech startup? Large Pharma? Do you want to run a group of be on the bench?  Give yourself 2 years, then with your knowledge either stay in industry as your career grows, or bail out temporarily and get the Ph.D. if you see its of value to where you've decided to go.  Note that your industry experience will put you light years ahead of any one else going directly into a Ph.D. program.

Few things bother me more in journal articles than when I read an article that is explicitly about theory ABC which was introduced in, for example, 1980, but the article then proceeds to only cite articles from 2010 and on as their sources about the theory. Give credit to the people who made the theory, especially if the focus of your article is on said theory; you should know the original source(s) and use them!  For references to replicated research findings, I recommend going to the most reputable source. Including multiple citations is always an option as well (at least in my field) though that can eat up a lot of words in our already limited journal space."

It said on the undergrad thread that we should comment our questions there if they don’t deserve a thread, if this doesn’t qualify for a thread I’ll just post it there.    I was going to go into aerospace, as I have a huge fascination with space and all the physics behind what lies with it. After researching a bit I found that it barely covers any of the truly interesting subjects about space and that it’s mostly related to mechanical engineering, which I also really like. My question is if there is something that can join all this and at least allow me to properly learn things like light, waves and quantum fields. Thank you for any help, I need to apply to a university really soon and it is quite a rough time, any help would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I feel like you've got a lot of buzzwords maybe going on here that don't necessarily add up to a cohesive thing. Just to lay things out:  You'll do lots of **quantum mechanics** if you do anything related to material science, solid-state physics, solid-state/semiconductor devices, electrical engineering (if you focus on said soild-state devices), condensed matter physics, particle physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, quantum computing or \"atomic, molecular and optics\" (so-called AMO) physics, engineering physics and \"applied\" physics (which is a degree some schools offer). That's not an exhaustive list, but gives you a sense.  By \"fields\" I assume you mean electrodynamics and not quantum field theory. You'll do lots of **electrodynamics** in electrical engineering (esp. radio or microwave engineering), solid-state physics, solid-state/semiconductor devices, optics and quantum optics. Again, not exhaustive but hopefully helpful.  If by \"mechanics\" you mean rigid-body mechanics, stress/strain, etc. You'll do this in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and mechatronics.  At this point it is worth pointing out that there is at least one field that combines **all three** of these so far in a single device and that would be the sub-field of solid-state devices called MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) or NanoElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS).  Finally you mention **space**. If that means you want to work for Space X or NASA in the future well there are a lot of roads to that. Satellites need electronics and control systems, aerodynamics, etc. So really any form of engineering could lead to space physics, not just aerospace engineering but also electrical, mechanical, mechatronic, control, system, etc. In fact the only field of engineering I have trouble seeing NOT being potentially to work in that field in the right situation is maybe civil engineering (until we start building roads on the moon :)). There is also of course astronomy and astrophysics which may also include heavy amounts of electrodyanmics or quantum physics (in nuclear astrophysics for example)."

As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both.            My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population.             When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences.                      I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying).               Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I'm pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC.   You are right to worry about jobs.  I looked at my local CC and they had 13 full-time faculty in psychology, 5 in sociology, and 1 in anthropology.  Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1.  I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over.  They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology.  At both schools, they each had a faculty member that was listed as dual in sociology and psychology which maybe gives a little credence to my friend's advice."

His job is very good for his level of education ($40K per year lab tech and he never went to college), and he some ambition for part of it, but on the other hand he hates certain parts of it and complains about the company being racist towards him and not letting him get the attention he needs to advance his career.

If he *wants* to move because he wants to stay with you, then you won't have to convince him, he's already convinced. If he *doesn't* want to move, then trying to convince him probably won't have any effect.  You need to talk about it with him, and he needs to decide what's important. The fact that you're long distance already means that I think this is a discussion that has long been coming. It seems like it's overdue at this point.

It's easy to ignore little issues when you have long periods of time between seeing each other. You're intentionally focused on having a good time, and on how much you've missed the person, and it's easier to forget about the little nagging things.  When you're around a person every day, those nagging things can become major issues. And when you've been doing the long distance thing for a while, and then someone moves, suddenly those nagging things (that you didn't really pay attention to) become a huge deal, because now you're well into the relationship and GODDAMMIT STOP LEAVING DIRTY DISHES IN THE SINK ALL DAY.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is: \"Are you sure you want him to move? And are you sure about the strength of the relationship?\"   Because if it comes apart, you still have your studies, your circle of grad school friends, and other things to keep you occupied.  He's stuck in a place with no friends, no network of connections for a job, etc.  You guys need to think about this *very* carefully."

Earlier this year, the US Department of Labor made rules raising the minimum salary without overtime pay to $47K/year.  The NIH and many universities responded by raising the minimum postdoc salary to this new minimum to avoid converting postdocs to hourly workers with 1.5x overtime pay.  You can see how various institutions and universities responded to this under \"Institutions and Funding Agencies: What they are doing\".  The rules were set to go into effect on December 1st, but last night a federal judge blocked them, and the next administration was already planning to undo these rules anyway, so it seems unlikely these rules will happen.  Now with only 7 days advance notice, how are your institutions responding to this?

For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me at the moment.

    "golden_answer": " Tl;dr: If you're working every day, 12 hours a day in a PhD program, you're doing it wrong or you're in a toxic lab.  I'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do you cope that you won't deliver a good thesis due to the pandemic? I will finish my PhD next year, but this week I entered the existencial crisis of a PhD: my thesis will not be good. I receive a scholarship from my government to develop my project, which I received after proposing three main objectives, two of them a bit risky but were mangeable - before covid hit. Since the pandemic began, everything I do came to a complete standstill, as I have to work on the laboratory, which was closed for almost a full year. I have a salary until July of next year, but I don't know what I will do until then or even after.  My country (brazil) is in the middile of a 3rd wave, with a 4th wave incoming. My state's healthcare system has already collapsed. Me and the other laboratory members have, since past month, made an agenda where we have no more than 2 people at the same time (so everyone has exactly one day in the week to do their work), but we all know that if we were to catch covid, it's stay at home and hope you don't die, because there is no more oxygen, hospital beds, the medicines used are slowly ending as well, and no vaccination in sight for us (in the brightest scenario, late november to mid december)  My first objective has been completely cancelled, impossible to do until late 2022, because the facility has closed. The second one involves an experimental technique that we still haven't been able to finish developing (people involved have left the city/state due to covid, facilities are still not open, purchase of new chemical reagents has been slow because everything is out of stock). The third objective requires me travelling to another side of the country (about 10h by bus) and spend some weeks working in another laboratory, something that not only is not recommended to due in the midst of our health crisis, but also I do not feel comfortable in doing as my immune system sucks and I'm very prone to getting sick, which is why I have been in quarantine for as much as I can, only leaving home for the essentials (and more recently to work).  So there we have it. I don't have anything to continue with my original plans and objectives, I don't know if I have a story to tell with all the incomplete and broken data that I have, and I'm scared shitless of having to do a complete 180º on my project which, if it's not accepted by my funding agency, they have the right to cancel my scholarship and demand that I pay them back everything that they have given me, which I mostly ceratinly cannot do. Besides changing everything when I have about 14 to 15 months left on my PhD (after this time I will be without a scholarship, and I cannot survive here without it due to money reasons), the only alternative I see is to lengthen this PhD until god knows when, when I'm finally able to complete all three objectives.

However, I can't quit this PhD (has to do with my visa status and my partner's job, so please don't recommend that I just quit).    I'm a firm believer in not complaining about something unless something can be done to fix the situation. However, I'm finding it really emotionally draining to smile and say everything is fine when I dread going into work and find myself crying on the bus home occasionally. They ask me constantly, nearly every day, whether I am liking the country and the project. I don't want to be insulting their country, and I know that it's in my best interest to just finish and get out. But is it okay to say something like \"No, I'm really not happy here, but I'm determined to finish the PhD.\" I suppose my goal in saying something like that is to (1) get them to stop asking me how happy I am and (2) see if they are able to allow me to graduate a little early.

    "golden_answer": " I did my PhD in the country that you are currently in (I read your post history) and I also had two supervisors from the countries you are dealing with.  Firstly, I'm sorry you're feeling terrible about your PhD and the country in general. I know it sucks. I really, really understand. My first year was hell. Luckily my supervisors spoke English well but my colleagues in my lab did not. The administration is a complicated, the people can be cold and standoffish, and the atmosphere can quickly become depressing.  Secondly, my advice about the country: Take a deep breath and get proactive. This country is known for its standoffish people when it comes to language. BUT there are many expats and travellers here. I advise you to seek out other international PhD students in your team/lab/building/university. Look for English Libraries and join in. Check your doctoral school and attend a mixer or two. 100% there are other international students who are struggling too, and there are probably PhDs of the country who can speak English and would be willing to help here and there for translation. Build your support network!  Thirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn't even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.  Lastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn't working\". But, if you feel you might want to continue, you'll need to consider a few things. HR is not your friend. Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you're not happy. I don't think they would be receptive to this.  But I strongly advise you to learn the language of the country. STRONGLY. Spend this holiday time putting in the energy and work. It will help you  immeasurably. The fact is, you are in their country and you need to speak the language. If they laugh at your poor grammar, who cares as long as you can communicate! If you choose to stay, take their behaviour towards you as part of the PhD - you need to defend your ideas, vision, and data. Take it as a learning experience, you will be a force to reckon with when you succeed. Good luck!  Also, I know a large network of international PhD students all around the country, give me a PM if you need support."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Dealing with students' unrealistic expectations about their grades and education in general (in US) I am a PhD student at a decent school in US, I am also a long time teaching assistant (my fifth year) and for all these years, the class that I was a TA for has been about the same subject, which is also my research topic. My interactions with students are my weekly office hours and grading their exams and assignments. This is where the problem begins: After every homework or exam that I grade, many students come challenging their grades by saying a variation of (i) \"My answer is same as the solution manual but I didn't get full credit.\", (ii) \"My solution is correct and solution manual is wrong.\" or (iii) \"My solution is same as my friend's but my grade is lower.\"  Aside Info: Even if the subject (taught at this level) is not really mathematical -other than being able to do primary school operations on numbers and comparing them with each other-, I guess it requires some sort of mathematical maturity to avoid fallacies. So answers to each question requires a \"proof,\" even though it is usually a one-liner but the students often lack the background to do it, which is somewhat surprising since most of them are seniors with some juniors at a good university.  I don't know the institutional reasons for the lack of background of the students and I understand that it may not be their fault that they were allowed to take this class without the proper background. However, I cannot possibly teach them proof techniques or basic logic either. I mean, they don't even need to write technical proofs, I just need a decently complete arguments about why some simple statement is true or false. To make this easier for them, I always write very clear solutions to each question after they submit their work, explain it step by step and show/argue that if you omit even one step, the answer would be incomplete.  Here is an example that illustrates the type of answers I get very often: \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd.\" (The actual subject concerns much simpler problems but this shows the type of fallacies I deal with on a daily basis.) Then, they argue that they deserve full credit, since they rightfully argued that \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd\".  I explain that their end result might be correct but their method is not; that this class is all about teaching the methods, and finally that the question explicitly requires an explanation which should be correct for the answer to be considered correct, hence they don't deserve full credit for it. (I feel embarrassed that I need to say things like this since it feels like an insult to their intelligence; if the question is not a multiple choice or \"Fill in the black\", these should be fairly obvious. Yet, I dealt with this for years now.) Then, they complain to the professor about this. I talk to the professor about it and we have a good laugh. (I don't remember any instance where a professor sided with the students about this issue and the professors are some of the top people in this field in the world so at this point I am fairly confident about my grading system.) This process repeats itself every week, every year.  I am sorry, I haven't had chance to rant about this in a while so I got a little carried away while trying to give some background. So, is there a systematic solution to my problem? What are your suggestions? I think I will suggest to the professor that we upload a practice problem set with the detailed solutions next term before the deadline for the first homework to set their expectations about our expectations but I don't know if this will work. So, I am open to any suggestion (that a reasonable professor would accept) at this point.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It's because of the type of education we have in the US before a student goes to college, where they are taught to memorize facts and get the right answer.

Then I got to college and every professor pointed out that is how NOT to do it.  As far as helping the students, I always suggest Shaum's Outlines for courses where applicable (got me through PhD level Quantum Mechanics)  You also have the issue of dealing with \"smart\" students.

    "golden_answer": " ECR here too. Your boss is right, classic imposter syndrome. Not to discourage you, but it may never go away, so you gotta embrace it and learn how to deal with it. You'll always be in a point in your career where you know enough of your topic that you know how complicated it is, and how little you know about it. The good thing, that's not true, you probable know a lot more than what you think and you're very likely more up-to-date with the latest literature than the PIs/postdocs. Mentally, novelty always seems to be more \"interesting\" than whatever you're doing, because if you can do it, everybody can do it too, right? Well, that's not true.   So, what can you do?  1. Don't trust yourself when you have those thoughts. 2. Take a step back. Draw on a paper the steps you took and highlight important bits that inspire you to do the experiment (that goes in the intro). Now it may seem like a very linear process, but it wasn't. You just need to remember the whole process.  3. Highlight interesting parts of the methods (or why the one you chose is the best approach). Get a coffee/tea/whatever is your poison, and try to find 3 main things you thought were interesting from to your findings (what do you want to tell people about what you did?). Even if the findings won't revolutionise science, your field, or change the World as we know it, it's still important to communicate confirmatory and negative results. And in science, we do it with a paper. 4. Remember that a project is ALWAYS better when it's finished than perfect. Perfection doesn't exist and if you go after it, it'll only feed the imposter monster inside your head and make you keep working for something unatainable. Prioritise feedback rounds (get as many as you can) than your own expectation. Good supervisor/collaborators will likely know better than you what's \"enough\" to submit. 5. Break down every section to paragraphs, then write a few lines about what the topic of the paragraphs should be. As you already have a previous draft, that gives you a headstart to identify what needs to be changed.  6. When stuck, look for help. Just send it to co-authors/supervisor and ask them what they think. Ask them to be precise and suggest the changes they want to see (I hate when co-authors just add a comment that says \"change/update\"). Sometimes things take way less effort than what we envisioned, which is amazing because in academia everything takes way longer than what we initially imagined.   Good luck!"

    "golden_answer": " Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable.   When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of 'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks.   It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester.   Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used."

The responsibility derives from the fact that you are first author: it is *your* paper, about *your* work.  None of that depends on who is paying your salary.  If you've left research and don't mind burning some bridges then sure, you can refuse to work on it and the professional ramifications will be fairly limited.

He used incentives like tying recommendation letters to doing things for him, giving excessive praise, and so on. I resisted. He tried to get me to teach his other students, and I said no. Now he assigns tasks to his students, and sends his students (and sometimes people he employed) to me for help. Out of nowhere, I find people asking me to do/teach them stuff, because my adviser told them I did a really good job in the past, and am a person they should refer to for help. I politely told my adviser that I do not want to involved in any of the non-thesis related work he does. He obviously doesn't care.  I got almost no value out of my adviser during my PhD years.

    "golden_answer": " Minimal guidance isn’t uncommon, and it often leads to very good independent PhDs. Some of the most effective advisors focus on writing proposals and selecting excellent students to do the work with a low level of supervision. If you are publishing well, you are likely doing well under this model. Even more important is that you have the opportunity to practice teaching and mentoring among junior students, and identify new opportunities to leverage old acquired skills to benefit your field of research. Just because it doesn’t pertain to your project, the fact that it benefits other projects means it is probably useful in your general area (“non-thesis related work he does”). So, I think you are missing the point that your advisor has created an environment in which you can learn independence (crucial for a successful PhD) and to learn to guide others in an area of your expertise (crucial if you want to supervise/mentor students or post docs some day). You should feel complimented that he respects your expertise and feel honored that he trusts you enough to work on his project without much input. You don’t need to like him, and can certainly feel bitter for slow/negligible input.   FWIW, I also worked in a relatively hands-off and high-expectations research group - with some guidance but also an unusual amount of independence (I wrote or contributed to five different proposals before graduating).

    "golden_answer": " One thing to keep in mind is that the current environment is incredibly *atypical*  because of the covid-19 pandemic. There are many programs in many disciplines that have simply suspended their normal intakes of graduate students, especially programs where there is simply no way to avoid having people in close physical proximity together in the course of doing professional training and research. So you need to not come to any fixed or final view of your qualifications or chances of admission under more normal circumstances, which hopefully will come back into view in the 2022-23 academic year (and thus will influence applications this coming fall).   However, if you want to look carefully to see if there's any issues in your applications that you can improve on before the next application cycle, the very best thing you could do is to show your applications from this year to a trusted undergraduate professor that you worked with--and if you had any peers or friends who were majors in Psychology at your university alongside you, show them too.   The other thing to keep in mind is even if it's true that the jobs you applied for were ones you were qualified for and should have been considered for, keep in mind that the atypicality of this year applies to those applications, at least since March 2020. It may well be true that many of those opportunities have gone to people who were known to the people running the lab as well, but you have to find a place to put your legitimate frustration and anger with that possibility out of mind temporarily while you are working on your applications--it can affect how you present yourself and your candidacy in ways that you might not pick up on."

Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \\(one since November \\-\\-\\- 5 months ago\\) saying he hasn't found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \\(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \\(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw \"my poster,\" which I didn't know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had made a conference poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter/manuscript that he \"hasn't had time to read\" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn't even cite my dissertation \\(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it's at least borderline unethical, but I don't want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \\(which I need since he hasn't let me publish\\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \\(Yes, it's his lab's research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\\).  2.\\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\\-over \\(for myself and to others\\). Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn't had the time to get to.   3.\\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?   I am worried about how this will play out in the future. I no longer need a letter of recommendation from this person for jobs \\(which is why I held my tongue in regards to previous issues I had with him\\), but I do need to finish several publications with him which I really need for my career and to show my current job I wasn't BS'ing about having forthcoming publications.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: 1st Year PhD - Removed From Project Until recently I was a 1st year PhD student working on my project. However, I was dismissed following my viva under the guise of \"poor writing\" in a continuation report for transfer into the 2nd year. Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z. Overall, the report and oral viva were praised for well thought out discussions, sound methodology, good results and clear progression/future plans (all documented) with just a vague \"introduction is poorly written\". However, when pressed the assessor could not/would not expand on this, dismissing me with \"its all poor\" contrary to the feedback he himself had provided! I was told my only options at this stage are to \"withdraw from your course, or submit an MPhil but I will not accept it\". Thus I am appealing this verdict.  After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would not remove someone for poor writing, if that is indeed the case. Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I've raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it's doubtful I'll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn't be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn't give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I've kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab. There's documented evidence of abuse of power, discrimination, harassment/bullying among other serious allegations that the university HAS known about ...but have just brushed  under the rug because they bring in too much money!

They use lots of strategies, but the overall bent is always \"won't you reconsider my grade due to these special circumstances?\" My consistent response is that they have been subjected to the same grading criteria as all other students in the class, and I haven't had any blowback from that (although it is something that raises my general concern level, mainly the possibility of a substantial amount of unnecessary work on my part if a grade is disputed).  Those who've been in the game longer, do you notice a similar trend in increased requests to increase final grades? Any suggestions on preempting this wave of nagging?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " While not a professor, I have been teaching 2-3 classes per semester for the past 3.5 years.  I get these sorts of emails every semester, usually from <5% of my students.  One strategy that I've employed is to try to minimize the amount of time between when I enter their final grades online (where they can see them) and when I assign final grades in our schools online portal (where they are final).  Usually I'll enter final exam grades late one afternoon, sleep on it, look it over in the morning, and then submit my final grades to the university.  This gives them less time to haggle as they know (at least at my institution), that it's difficult to change once they've been officially submitted to the university.  The other strategy I've employed is emailing them as soon as final exam grades are entered, to a.) let me know grades are posted and b.) remind them that their grade is final and there is nothing they can do at this point to change their grade.  These things helped me go from getting these emails from 10% of my class to getting them from <5%.  Your mileage may vary."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Are professors subject to the \"hedonic treadmill\" professionally? The hedonic treadmill basically posits that human happiness is fairly stable; after we achieve some goal we fall back to a base level of satisfaction and then strive toward a new goal. In essence, we keep plugging along on the treadmill in order to maintain the same relative level of satisfaction with our lives.  I'm an academic. Most of my friends are academics. We have had *countless* discussions about how each of the professional milestones (earning a Ph.D., landing a TT job, tenure, promotion to associate, promotion to full, publishing a book, etc.) are only temporarily fulfilling. After each of these markers comes and goes, we are left wondering \"what's next?\" and striving toward the next rung of the ladder.  The problem-- for some at least --comes with promotion to full professor, because there are no rungs on the ladder above that. Is that dissatisfaction simply a reflection of being on the hedonic treadmill? Is it a symptom of a certain type-A personality required to make it that far professionally to be unhappy with no further goals?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I would like to address the premise of the question.  I think the issue may not be the hedonic treadmill, but that the time between the inception of an academic goal and reaching it (plus the often immense effort to get there) changes us.  When we reach our destination, we are no longer the same person who set the goal, thus it doesn't end-up satisfying us the way we originally expected.  An example of this is getting a PhD.  When you are starting grad school, the process of how to actually finish your PhD seems pretty overwhelming and difficult.  It should, at that point.  But time passes and you master the skills and gather the information needed while overcoming the inevitable obstacles.  In this process, you grow and change as a professional and a person in many ways, both because of the arduous experience and merely the passage of time and other experiences. Plus, you had probably already begun to think about the next goal as soon as the end of the PhD was in view. The subsequent goal had since begun to supplant the proximate one.  By the time you have finished defending and editing your dissertation, it wasn't nearly the overwhelming task you imagined when you first set that goal for yourself, and you were already well into thinking about and planning for your next step.  This process repeats over and over: getting an academic job, tenure, your first big grant, etc.  If it didn't take so much time and effort to do these things, if we didn't need to sacrifice along the way (as well as feel the delight of smaller milestones met, of course), I don't think we would much more \"satisfied\" with our accomplishments.  Although I also think that getting what we wish for extremely easily and quickly can lead to chronic dissatisfaction, extreme amounts of time and effort -- paradoxically -- can have the same effect."

Turns out the author copied paragraphs of text verbatim from a separate project that I’m involved with and wrote the background for. Same text, same references, everything. The project details are not publicly available yet, so only the project team has had access to this document along with select reviewers. Additionally I found text copied from email correspondences that I had with a few team members in the manuscript and were portrayed as this individual’s commentary, so I’m pretty confident I know who this person is now.  To make things even more absurd, I previously reviewed a paper where the suspected individual was the lead author (was not blinded for that one) and noticed the background section was copied from another online resource. I let the editor know about this issue at the time and advised that the section be revised and cite back to the online resource. At the time I tried to give this person the benefit of the doubt so left it at that.  I now have two occurrences over a short time frame where this person has plagiarized text and I’ve caught them. This second time they plagiarized me for about 50% of the manuscript and I’m really mad. This person is at a different institution, but I’m going to have to interact with this person frequently through this project and our field generally.

This individual has also completed more than enough training and published several times to know how wrong all of this is. I’m now also concerned they’ve likely used material from me and others for other grants/projects they’ve been working on as well.  We are going to notify the journal about what happened, but what other steps should be taken? This is just so egregious.

I will be graduating in a year and am starting to look at PhD programs. Recently I joined a new research group in a subject that I am highly interested in, but do not have a lot of background in. Prior to this I was in a research group for a little over a year, but in a completely different field. The second I heard back from the new group I basically had a panic attack: I felt fraudulent, like I somehow tricked them into saying yes; thoughts that I'm not smart or accomplished enough keep crossing my mind even still.   I've heard of impostor syndrome and realized that what I'm experiencing is consistent with some of the things I've heard about it; however, just recognizing that what I'm experiencing is normal doesn't help very much. I feel a lot of self-doubt and I find myself avoiding the work for the group because I'm afraid of not understanding something and looking stupid. I know a lot of graduate students go through this, so what are some tips to help get over this self doubt and fear of failure?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Maybe hearing the perspective of the other side will help.  When an undergrad joins our research group I always assume that they don't know anything (most of the time that's true).  We've all been there before.   I didn't know anything when I first joined as an undergrad and it was really scary.  I would sit in on our research meetings and have no idea what the hell anyone was talking about.  Now I'm the one rambling on in the meetings while the undergrads sit there and wonder what the hell I'm talking about.  It just takes time.  Everyone I know prefers the student who asks too many questions over the student who doesn't ask anything.  Students who don't ask questions end up costing us way more time in the end.  Like I said, we've all been there before.  Nobody is born with this knowledge in their brains, and the big secret in academia (well, really the entire world) is that nobody actually knows what the hell is going on.  Ask questions, no matter how simple.  I'm a 2nd year PhD student and just this week I had to ask my advisor how to calculate a confidence interval around a sample proportion (for the record that's a 2nd year undergrad topic in my field).  Just make sure you project a willingness to learn on your own provided they can point you in the right direction.  Professors are busy people and they don't always have time to teach undergrads everything they need to know.  Edit: Something a bit more practical is to retain perspective on the world around you.  I have old friends who dropped out of community college to do heroine and work at fast food joints.  It's messed up and of course I try to help if I can, but things like that help me keep a balanced perspective on life.

I have an undergrad degree in French, and I’ve bounced around in ideas, thinking about getting a grad degree in Linguistics, social work, French, TESOL, on and on. The main issue for me is passion vs financial security. The things that would give me the most job options are uninteresting to me, and the things that do interest me…not a lot of career options. It’s not that I need to make a lot of money, to be clear. It’s the fear that I’ll get the degree and not be able to support myself at a minimum and pay off my debt, if I can’t find a job.   Philosophy seems like the worst fit for this! It’s not a versatile degree! But it’s the most interesting to me. I know I love language, and I think studying philosophy of language would be fascinating. My mind works very abstractly, I love the theoretical and abstract, and I love living an examined life. I think it might be the perfect fit.   When I think about what I would think about my life when I’m nearing my end, I don’t want to think, “man, I paid off that debt fast.

But, say it doubles again over that data - there's still only ~10-15 jobs related to phil language every year.  If you're goal is to have an interesting experience and learn from interesting people, then go for it, especially if you are young, don't care where you live, and can live off ~$20k/yr.  If you want a PhD for some other reason, think hard about what those reasons are. You may develop some transferable skills studying philosophy, but no one outside of academia will give a shit that you have a PhD. If you were strategic, you could incorporate some linguistics or NLP into your studies (but this doesn't sound like your jam).  Finally, grad school spots in philosophy are super competitive. Depending on how much philosophy you did as an undergrad, you may need to take some post-bacc classes or audit some grad seminars in order to put together a decent application and find profs to write letters for you.  My advice, fwiw, would be to look into a funded MA - you can see if academic philosophy is really for you, and put together a really solid PhD application.  source: I am a PhD student in philosophy"

I love research and also enjoy teaching, so it has always felt like academia is a good fit for me, but now I am seriously considering moving to industry instead.      The main reason for this is that I am doing less and less technical work myself: programming, building testbeds, running experiments, analysing data, writing papers.

This is meant for someone that it toward the end of their doctorate and would be expected to complete their doctorate within the first year of employment (typically).  A common example is someone that defends their dissertation over the summer before starting a job in August, but the university does not officially grant the degree until the December graduation.   Of course, there is nothing wrong with shooting off an email to the search committee chair and ask if they are willing to consider someone with a MS.

I'm about to finish my first year as a PhD student and I received a master's degree in a related field previous to this, so this is not my first graduate school/research experience. I deal with imposter syndrome here on a near-constant basis. It feels like my questions or ideas are not received well or in the same way as other graduate students in my lab or department by faculty members, and I have a hard time articulating what I'm trying to say/do. I get interrupted a lot when I try to join in academic conversations when my peers don't, with the end result of me feeling like my original thoughts were dumb/unimportant to begin with and that it is now the expectation when I open my mouth. I feel awful, slow, and completely out of place- it's starting to give me anxiety in every aspect of research and school!   What tips/techniques do you use when you start to feel this way?

    "golden_answer": " 1) If you really feel you're being less well-received than your peers, that sucks. But you're still just finishing your first year. You have years to improve your base knowledge and articulation.  2) Just as a general psychology thing, you notice things you do and what happens to you a lot more than other people do. Some of those other people you think are getting more respect may feel exactly the same as you do.  3) For better or for worse, anyone in grad school with any bit of self-awareness and a normal-sized ego will likely feel imposter syndrome at least at some point. It is rampant, even if people around you don't talk about it. Trust me. Those people that don't get interrupted probably feel it, for maybe different reasons.  4) Always remember, your advisor has more experience than you. Potentially far more. But they picked you. Out of potentially dozens or hundreds of actual or potential applicants, they picked you. Trust in their experience and rise to what they saw in you."

I relied on some data generated by a previous student, so myself, him, and our PI are the only authors on the manuscript. My PI suggested that I send it to this 2nd author for review/editing/comments, and then a couple of other colleagues in the lab for internal review before the PI reads it himself.  The first round goes great and my 2nd author returns great comments after a week worth of 2 back and forth. I proceed to send it to the next person, who's a post-doc turned research associate - too long of a tenure as a post-doc, he had to switch to being an RA. I get my comments back from the RA and I see that he has added himself as an author on my paper. I looked through the document and the comments/edits he's suggesting aren't any better/more thorough than what my 2nd author did. Mostly grammar/language and \"cite this please\" sort of commentary. I never discussed adding him as another author on my paper and I wasn't aware he was going to do it. From going through the document several times, I am also likely going to reject many of the edits as I don't think he fully grasped my paper and some of the comments are more confusing than helpful.  I haven't told my PI yet and I'm unsure if he has looked at the document.

I am a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th author on several papers and for all of them I personally did work and provided data for a figure or several to guarantee authorship.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit,  It’s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20).  I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later.  At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn’t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don’t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one.   The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues’ success.  From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy “rules” from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling:  1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don’t value being “just” a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won’t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals.  This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\".  5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people’s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line.   I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this — or even telling me this is normal.  Thanks a lot.\n\nAssistant:",

Except for #2, I generally agree with your rules, even though it may not be healthy - I can't really help it.

While it's true that one does need to acquire that skill, I think any student would pick that up by the end of their PhD no matter what.

I was amazed at the people in my area who had never read seminal papers that their work was based on. If you are one of the people who do like to read, you don't need anyone's help. Start with the textbooks and just go read the original papers they cite. You will read hundreds and hundreds of shitty papers to find a dozen gems. You will find that often modern interpretations of classic papers are exactly backwards (Stephan J. Gould wrote an essay on this once). You will find errors in authors, procedures, and interpretations that have been passed from one lazy academic to another. It's amazing how frequently papers get cited from other papers rather than being read- just like lazy undergraduates. You will spend hours in the library since the good stuff isn't available online. You will order stuff from interlibrary loan (and I don't care how good your school's library is). You may find yourself picking up a reading knowledge of a second language (much of the classic physiology literature is in German and French for instance). Third, if you can't get started on this journey yourself then you should reconsider grad school. Harsh, but true. Simply grab a textbook or a classic review paper (use World of Knowledge or whatever ISI calls it these days to grab a high impact review from 10-20 years ago) and start reading it and the stuff it cites. You don't want to follow the herd on this one, you are becoming a scholar so it's time you learned to dig stuff up for yourself and form your own opinions about it. Good luck!"

A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots.  That being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit.  The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR.
