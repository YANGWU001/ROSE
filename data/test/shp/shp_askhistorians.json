    "golden_answer": " I've had the pleasure of talking about Roman concrete several times on AskHistorians. This is an edited and slightly expanded version of an older answer:  Building techniques never die. They just become irrelevant...  First, some background on Roman concrete. Concrete is best understood as a type of mortar. Mortar (the stuff that holds courses of bricks or blocks together) is typically composed of water, sand, and lime. There are variations - the Chinese, famously, made mortar by mixing lime with sticky rice - but in the Classical Mediterranean, the water, sand, and lime formula was always standard.  Roman concrete differed from Roman mortar by virtue of its \"secret ingredient\" - the volcanic ash known as pozzolana, which was used in place of regular sand. This was really just a case of good geological luck on the Romans' part: Rome happened to be located near large deposits of pozzolana (later, even larger deposits would be discovered on the Bay of Naples). Roman masons quickly discovered that mortar made with pozzolana was much stronger that mortar made with regular sand. And so concrete was born.  It should be noted here that not all Roman concrete was made with pozzolana. Most Italian concrete was, and pozzolana was occasionally shipped to (coastal) cities in other parts of the Empire (Herod the Great had a batch brought all the way to Caesarea in modern Israel). But there were deposits of volcanic ash with similar properties in the provinces (above all in the Greek islands). Roman builders eventually discovered, moreover, that a fairly good concrete could be made by using crushed terracotta in place of pozzolana.  Contrary to what you might think, the Romans were seldom adventurous builders. Roman architects received no formal training, and had no way of mathematically modeling forces or stresses or other things likely to cause the collapse of buildings and careers. As a result, they tended to be very conservative in their use of building materials. At first, they only used concrete to save time when building thick walls: instead of making the wall of building four or five brick courses thick, they simply built brick facings and filled the interior of the wall with a mixture of rubble and concrete.  Sometime in the first century BCE, the Romans discovered that concrete made with pozzolana could harden underwater - in fact, thanks to chemical reactions the Romans knew nothing about, saltwater actually strengthened the material, forming nearly unbreakable mineral bonds. So in the waning days of the Republic, Romans began to build \"artificial harbors\" like the famous example at Caesarea Maritima. But the great days of concrete architecture still lay ahead.  Only in the mid-first century CE, under the stimulus of imperial funding and imperial demands, did concrete begin to be used to create the spectacular vaults and domes that are the greatest achievement of Roman architecture. The revolutionary moment came in the reign of Nero, when the architects Severus and Celer (about whom we know nothing) created an impressive series of concrete rooms for Nero's infamously decadent Golden House. These represented the culmination of nearly a century of experimenting with vaults, primarily in the large, imperially-sponsored bath buildings. Once Severus and Celer showed what concrete could do, the creative floodgates, for the first time in Roman architectural history, were truly open.  The next century and a half witnessed the construction of the most famous Roman monuments: the Colosseum (supported by a colossal concrete foundation), the Pantheon (crowned by a spectacular concrete dome), the Baths of Caracalla (roofed by an awesome series of concrete vaults and domes), the Basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum (likewise vaulted) and so on.  Concrete was also used in the provinces, but always on a much smaller scale. The basic reason was simple: the Roman emperors, by an incredible margin the wealthiest men in the Empire, seldom sponsored building projects outside Rome. In large provincial cities like Alexandria or Antioch or Ephesus, very impressive building projects were undertaken. But these were financed by the benefactions of wealthy citizens (often working in concert); and provincial notables, for all their wealth, could never create anything on the scale of the concrete-crowned projects in Rome. As a result, provincial concrete tended to be used more conservatively. This was not solely a matter of scale - in the Greek east, for example, a well-established tradition of fine masonry ensured that stone, not concrete, was often used in domes - but without imperially-sponsored scale or imperially-sponsored funding, the use of concrete had a fairly limited scope.  Once the emperors stopped paying for large-scale construction projects, concrete largely reverted to what it had been before the Roman architectural revolution: a useful filler for thick walls. Roman concrete was not forgotten in the early middle ages, at least not in Byzantium: Procopius (*Buildings*, 1.11-18-20) mentions Justinian using Roman hydraulic concrete to build a new harbor in Constantinople. But after this, aside from a few mentions in Isidore of Seville's *Etymologies* (e.g. 15.8.1), concrete virtually vanishes from the literary record.  The domes of Justinian's Haghia Sophia, the last great product of Roman engineering, were made of brick bedded in concrete. But after Justinian, the troubles that overtook the Eastern Empire (like those that had destroyed the imperial order in the west a century earlier) virtually ended monumental building for centuries. And in those centuries, concrete vaults and domes became, like so much else across the former Roman world, mementos of a vanished past.  On the techniques of laying and modeling Roman concrete, I refer you to my video on the Pantheon."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Given that Pre-Islamic Arabia was a very women-friendly and sexually \"liberal\" society, what is the source of Islam's extremely puritanical culture? In Robert G. Holyland's Arabia and the Arabs, various historical sources are mentioned that tell us pre-Islamic Arabian culture was one in which women could marry multiple men, advertise for mercenary husbands when they wanted children, had the right to dismiss their husbands when they wanted, enjoyed significant financial independence, with Arab tribes sometimes having matrilinear lineages, female gods, and queens.   The Qur'an partially mentions some of this (like the female gods, decrying them) and urges Muslim women not to emulate the women of the time of ignorance in their bedizenment, with the Tafsirs pointing out to pre-Islamic Arabian women dressing in a skimpy manner and without modesty. **How come that Islam, which developed against this backdrop, came to be such a puritanical religion in which any sexual or romantic affection before marriage is heavily frowned upon, and in which women have to cover themselves partially or fully almost all the time?**\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Hey!  So this has a couple of different parts that I hope to address.  I can't give a super specific answer, but will try to touch on a number of facets you could ask follow-up questions about.  I'm pulling some from previous answers that I have written, but much of this is also new.  A great book on this topic is Leila Ahmed's book *Women and Gender in Islam*, which I will heavily use below.  # Part 1 – Quick Note on Veiling Itself  Because you specifically mentioned it, I wanted to start with a small section on veiling itself.  Veiling was common practice in multiple pre-Islamic societies across the Middle East.  In Assyrian culture wearing a veil separated between a 'respectable' woman and those who were 'up for grabs', so to say.  Upper class women, concubines accompanying those women, and former \"sacred prostitutes\" all had to wear it whereas normal prostitutes and slaves were forbidden from veiling themselves, even so far as being under threat of flogging or having their ears cut off.  Ahmed then writes that this practice spread throughout the upper-class Mediterranean world - from the Levant through to Persia - and also crossed religious lines appearing in Byzantine Christian societies.  Here, Ahmed gives the example of a 10th century Byzantine patriarch who wrote that he only allowed his daughter to go out \"veiled and suitable chaperoned\".  She also notes the reasoning, separating the respectable from the rabble, remains constant even in these other societies.    However, that is not to say that veiling was necessarily widespread in Arabia itself.  Women of the *jahilyya* pre-Islamic period did not normally don a veil. This of course varied from city to countryside, with cities being more likely to veil.  Overall, nowhere was the veil common to the extent of places like neighboring Syria and Palestine.  As you noted in your question, sexual relations in Arabia were more open than in those other societies, with both polygamy and polyandry being present.   Through Muhammad's entire life, the only women who were regularly veiled or secluded were his wives. Through successful revelations received by Muhammad, the practice of veiling and seclusion took hold among them, getting to the point where the phrasing \"she took the veil\" became synonymous to \"she became a wife of Muhammad\".  Various impetuses pushed Muhammad towards these rulings.  For example, it was after he became annoyed with guests staying too long chatting with his wives after dinner that the Sura 33 was revealed, within which verse 54 details that one should only speak to Muhammad's wives from behind a curtain. The word he uses for curtain is *ḥijāb*.  Most westerners associate the word *hijab* with some sort of head-wrap of veil, but it also literally can mean 'veil' in the sense of a curtain.  Verse 59 then gives the commandment to women to \"bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.\"  This is allegedly in response to the \"hypocrites\", mere nominal converts to Islam, harassing Muslim women and claiming to have thought they were slaves.  Finally, I should note that the later second Caliph, Omar, was a proponent of seclusion of women and veiling and actively pushed Muhammad towards this position.  # Part 2 – The evolution of the Woman’s place  This is what I suspect to be the more interesting section – why did Islam develop the way it did, when women played such major roles in pre-Islamic and early Islamic times?  In the *jahilyya*, and within early Islam, women contributed in a number of facets of life.  Women were soothsayers and prophetesses such as Sajah, a Christian woman of the Banū Tamīm who led a force of over 4,000 along with Musaylimah, “The Liar”, in rebellion against the nascent Muslim state.  Like the previous sentence indicates, they were also involved in warfare. They were not only poets, telling stories of the battles and engaging in ritualistic pre-battle exchanges of insults, but also warriors themselves. Umm ‘Umara fought at a number of battles alongside men, eventually losing her hand at the Battle of ‘Uqraba in 634.  Women were heavily involved in early Islamic religious life, providing the many of the *hadith* that came to guide religious life.  It was common for them to remarry, showing there to be a lack of stigma against non-virgins, and often they brought significant wealth to these relationships (Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija, was one such widow.  15 years his senior, she was rich enough to allow Muhammad to not have to work, allowing him to instead focus on his spiritual teachings).   #**So why did this begin to change?**  The changes actually started before the spread of Islam, as merchants in urban Arabian cities were increasingly exposed to the norms and cultures of lands with much more rigid gender roles.  This can be seen as an explanation as to why it was the cities, not the countryside, that first adopted veiling.  However, what brought the changes into hyperdrive was the rapid expansion of the early Islamic Empire.  Not only did this bring increased contact with these foreign cultures, but it also brought an influx of slaves, diminishing the bargaining power of even Arab-born women.   The conquests brought untold wealth to the Arabs.  Even regular soldiers were able to afford slaves, houses, and concubines.  Accordingly, women lost one of their original bargaining chips – the wealth they brought to marriages.  Further, as a condition for surrendering and keeping their place, many Persian and Sassanian nobles converted to Islam. They kept, however, their original cultures.  One of the features that developed around this time was the harem, with a multitude of women being walled off for rich and powerful men, guarded only by Eunuchs.  With easy access to sex slaves, Ahmed argues that the line between “woman” and “object” started to blur.  Men did not need to put up with the demands stipulated by Arab women’s wedding contracts when they had access to sex elsewhere.  Women faced increasingly strict restrictions and were treated increasingly poorly.  Some elite men even went so far as to lament the fact that they had to marry their daughters, as their standards of living would so dramatically fall.  Ahmed included the following poem in her book, written from one noble man to another on the occasion of his daughter’s death.  This did not come from a sense of general misogyny, that daughters were worthless, but rather from the degradations and humiliations their daughters were liable to face.   > To Abu Hasan I offer condolences.   > At times of disaster and catastrophe   > God multiplies rewards for the patient.   > To be patient in misery   > Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.   > Among the blessings of God undoubtedly   > Is the preservation of sons   > And the death of daughters.  But cultural and economic changes are only a portion of the story.  Also in play was the religious framework that marriage operated within. Islamic law works through a local judge, a *Qadi*, issuing a ruling on a specific case so that it is in line with religious teachings (we have to note that there was no separation between the illegal and the immoral, but rather they were the one and the same).  However, while the Qur’an protected women’s rights in a number of areas, judges often interpreted these not as legally binding rules, but rather as binding only upon the individual’s conscience.  So, a man would not be legally bound to treat his 4 wives fairly, even if that is a stipulation within the Qur’an itself. There was, in essence, the loss of many Qur’anic provisions that could protect women.  The 11th century also brought the *Closing of the Gates of Ijtihad*.  That is, Islamic jurisprudence reached a point where they (allegedly) decided that there had been sufficient rulings in the past that any questions which need an answer were answerable, and it is was longer necessary to use independent reasoning to come to new solutions (for more on this, see my answere [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7vynzv/when_and_why_did_muslim_countries_stop_using_the/dtwak37/))  This in essence froze many Islamic teachings. There are 4 main schools of Sunni Islamic thought, and at the point of the closing of the gates of Ijtihad, only the Maliki school allowed for women to obtain a divorce on the grounds of desertion or cruelty. Meanwhile, only the Hanafi school fully enforced marriage contracts that would bind a man to monogamy.  While before the closing of these gates a judge could, theoretically, use his own reasoning to analogize and come to a new ruling, they were now largely bound to *taqlid*, imitation of the past. So, these doctrines, along with countless others controlling women’s lives, ceased to develop at the same speed as before.  That is not to say that women were completely locked out, as one could effectively “shop” between the different schools of thought for the most favorable ruling.  There is much, much more one could write on this topic, but I unfortunately have work that I have to do.  I hope this can help begin to answer your question, and if you have follow-ups I’ll try to respond if possible."

    "golden_answer": " Hi,  This is by no means an area I am an expert in. However, that being said, I will attempt to answer in general about European immigration to the United States in the 19th century because I've been teaching subjects like this for nearly a decade. This answer is general and wide-ranging and not an in-depth look at Norwegians as immigrants, per se. Think of it as a Freshman-level survey lecture. One final disclaimer that, I think, fits with any question about historical motivations and actions; \"It's complicated.\"  With those out of the way, let's delve a little into the phenomena of American migration and the immigrant story as a whole:  * Immigration to the United States was the product of \"boosterism\"  Basically, both officials from the US government and citizens alike 'sold' life in the United States as a golden opportunity. Mind you, this was not unique to the United States itself; the [British government used to advertise owning farms and land and opportunity in Canada] (http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e350/e008748903-v8.jpg) to the swelling populations of the 19th century. In fact, some have argued that ['transportation'] (http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies) to Australia was also a release valve for excess population. Essentially, there was a wide-ranging 'sales' pitch to draw Europeans (and Asians) to \"The West\" (a vague, wide term that includes many places we would not think of as 'western' today.)   A good example of this sales pitch, though coming at the tail end of the 19th century, is the adventuresome [\"dime novels\"] (https://blogs.baylor.edu/texascollection/2013/08/13/dime-novels-the-rise-of-the-american-hero/) which, tall tales aside, painted the West as an empty land ready for exploitation. Newspaper reporters and fiction writers alike jumped upon the bandwagon of these tales because appetite for them in Europe pretty much guaranteed newspaper sales (and writers' incomes). Moreover, and perhaps more famously, [\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Shows\"] (https://centerofthewest.org/learn/western-essays/wild-west-shows/) romanticized America to the European market; America was a place where a man could prove his manliness through near-mythical deeds! He was immensely popular and his act performed for Queen Victoria and the Pope by the end of the 19th century.   Can't imagine getting swept up in the fever of a new land? Well, imagine if a newssite broke the story of a previously-unknown continent that was 'empty' and ready for settling. A place where you could start a new life with a new name and a new identity. How many 21st century Americans themselves would leap at the chance to abandon debt, shitty credit scores, acrimonious politics, social inequality, economic disparity, and the banal evils of corporate life for an opportunity for adventure and excitement?  Add to this stories of immigrants who 'made it' in the USA - people like [Levi Strauss] (https://www.biography.com/people/levi-strauss-9496989), [Andrew Carnegie] (https://www.biography.com/people/andrew-carnegie-9238756), and [Adolphus Busch] (https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/b/busch/) - and you have a powerful incentive to risk literally everything in a voyage to the USA and traversing unknown regions of a dangerous continent.  * Free land/cheap land is better than expensive land/hereditary land.  Unlike Europe, the Canadian/American West had lots of 'unused' land, according to boosters (please know it certianly wasn't \"empty\" nor \"unused\" but that's a different conversation). This goes hand-in-hand with the above point; it was a tradition in North America to offer cheap or free land to entice Europeans over to the New World, but these (such as the Headright acts in 1600s Virginia) were met with mixed results. The difference between 1600 and 1800 boils down to changes in agriculture and medicine in Europe which led to higher populations and over-crowding of the land and cities. This, in turn, led to high land and property prices (as well as taxes) for new families, meaning many people's dreams of having their own farm/land/business would always be a 'dream.'  Comparatively, the US government offered free land periodically through things like the Homestead Act of 1862 which opened up millions of acres of land for a pittance in order to get European (read \"White Europeans\" from North and West Europe) and American presences in the region; this would lead to settled farmers producing food and forcing out the Native Americans whose land it really was (though the US gov't conveniently neglected to tell Europeans as such). About 1.5 million homesteaders, not all of whom were US citizens by birth, took up the offer of free or nearly-free land during the lifetime of the Act and its 'spin offs' (smaller, more regional acts that hoped to have the same draw) continued well into the 20th century, drawing people to places like Nebraska. Best of all, taxes - if they existed at all in the region - were miniscule compared to Europe. Free land and no taxes? Sign me up, right?  So, Europeans had a choice; stay and maybe scrape enough together to maybe afford some land or sell pretty much everything and take a gamble on snagging some 'free' land.  * Europeans were politically convulsed  While not quite as applicable to Scandinavians, most of Europe at the time was going through some pretty scary political, social, and economic upheavals that made staying in Europe in the mid-19th century particularly dicey. German, Italian, Irish, Polish, and many other Europeans were faced with [political revolution, unemployment, and literal starvation] (http://www.ushistory.org/us/25f.asp) in the mid-19th century. The option then was to stay and maybe die or to take a gamble and maybe live. A good example is the Potato Blight which most famously affected the Irish (leading to over half the population dying or fleeing to foreign shores), but Germany and Belgium were also affected deeply, especially the poor and working class whose diet was extremely dependent upon the humble spud. Comparatively, with the exception of 1860 to 1865, the United States seemed relatively stable and prosperous.  Stay and die or move and live (probably)? Which would you choose?  * Relatives and community were already here in some cases.  Only a relative few immigrants 'blazed the trail' so to speak. Many were enticed to come to the USA by relatives and friends who had gone before. Immigrant communities - speaking their mother tongue primarily (or exclusively) - were common in the \"West.\" Many frontier cities had newspapers and laws passed in the mother tongue, despite being in the USA. Why? Comfort and familiarity. Immigrants banded together in order to look out for each other and provide a sense of continuity and 'normalcy' to their new lives. Larger communities drew more people and made possible more success stories. Usually, more immigrants settled relatively stable areas and only the truly desperate or foolhardy settled 'frontiers.'  I like your term \"unbuilt\"; the immigrant experience allows the newcomer to craft a world closer to their liking. It gave immigrants agency in crafting their future; a world that had all the good stuff of the homeland and all the stuff they liked about the new place. This is something they could never really have done even in the most liberal of European countries. Interestingly, the act of \"building\" reinforced cooperation and community while, ironically, perpetuating the myth of rugged individualism and made the transition from settled Europe to 'unbuilt' USA more palatable and less scary.  In conclusion, there are a LOT of reasons why a Norwegian would come out to the badlands of the West and persevere in the face of such hardships. But a combination of sales pitch, free land, a desire to remake the world as you see fit, and the lure of 'making it' all combine into a rather powerful impulse to \"go to such a far distance.\"  Sources:  *Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People* by Alan Brinkley 2014  *Immigrant America: A Portrait* by Alejandro Portes et. al 2006  *Norwegians and Swedes In America: Friends and Neighbors* Ed by Philip Anderson et. al. 2012  *Immigrants in the American Civil War* History channel, American History in Film database, 2008  [The Buffalo Bill Center of the West] (https://centerofthewest.org/)  [Library of Congress: The Homestead Act] (https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/may-20)  EDIT: Spelling mistakes here and there (how did you guys let me get away with that?)"

John Singer Sargent apparently was no stranger to brothels, as this page about the painting notes at the top.  Prostitutes were basically the typical way that European men gained access to women in the Middle East in the 19th century, with sometimes preposterous results. So for example when Gustave Flaubert was traveling in Egypt he described the erotic \"dance of the bee\". It was erotic because the performer was a prostitute he had paid and then slept with.  This and other descriptions by 19th century European observers writing about how their prostitutes danced for them created a fundamental misunderstanding of what Arab dance consisted of, among other things.  There were some exceptions. Edward William Lane writing in the 1830s recruited his sister to report on the goings on in the harems, bath houses, and other women-only spaces that he could not be admitted to."

    "golden_answer": " This depends onwhat you mean by where and also when you are asking.   So we know that native accounts (recorded about 30 years after the conquest) imply that some of the aztecs thought the Spanish might be gods. Yet, most scholars believe that this is likely a later addition which was meant to explain how Moctezuma (one of the most successful emperors of the Aztecs) could have been defeated. The Spanish sources from the 1520s do not contain such references and only later Spanish sources pick it up. Although certain aspects of the Spanish arrival could loosely map on to Aztec myths of a god returning, I believe it stretches the imagination that such a belief could be held for any length of time, and the Spanish were in near constant contact with native peoples for months before the main military phase of the conquest began.  Second, where did the Aztecs think they came from. Well, the Spanish told them, Castile. We know the earliest name given to the Spanish was Castilteca, meaning 'people from Castile'. This also tends to suggest that the Aztecs saw the Spanish as people not gods because they rendered them using the same forms as they would any other new people group they encountered. This is not surprising. We know the Aztecs had trading connections with groups far flung from central mexico and would have had no cultural barrier to understanding that people could be from locations vastly distant. The Spanish were certainly the first to come from over the ocean, but other than that they were just another group.

I figured since everything that breathes and doesnt have a respirator suffocates when trenches are flooded with mustard gas or other chemical weapons, it might kill all the rats and lice in the trench. Was this the case?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Mustard gas is certainly lethal to rats, not to mention other small critters that inhabited the hellish landscape of the front. Plenty of data exists on *exactly* what mustard gas, not to mention just about any other hazardous chemical, will do to a rat as they of course are often the laboratory subjects for tests to determine exactly that, not to mention countless other unfortunate creatures like mice, pigs, dogs, horses, and so on. The super short summary though if we cut to the chase for the LD50 of mustard gas, as that was the one you mentioned (although  I presume you are interested more in WWI chemical warfare than *mustard gas*, so will also speak more generally about the former's impact), it is as follows:  Species | Route | LD50 (mg/kg) ---|---|--- Human | Oral | 0.7 Human | Dermal | 100 Rat | Oral | 17 Rat | Dermal | 5  Other gases too, of course, were tested on rats and other animals, both during and long after the war. In a report from 1917 by the British Chemical Warfare Medical Committee, we see several examples of this:  >Field experiments have shown that a rat and rabbit placed about five yards from, and to leeward of, a bomb  containing phosgene were found dead within eight minutes after its  explosion. Control animals similarly situated to windward died after  several hours. Other controls, in which shells filled with water instead  of toxic substances were used, have shown that the concussion must  not be regarded as a cause of death.   >Similar results have been obtained in laboratory experiments at  Cambridge and elsewhere. Mice exposed to a high concentration of  phosgene in a small closed chamber may die during the third minute.   The rats knew the danger the gas posed too. One of the warnings of an incoming attack for the soldiers in the trenches would be the fuzzy stampede as the rats which had been inhabiting No Mans Land fled in front of the oncoming clouds that drifted towards the trench, their squeaks of terror amplifying the official alarms. The aftermath would see the carcasses of rats strewn about, as well as other small mammals and avian life that had been eking out a survival there, or was forced into the trench of course, such as horses of dogs. A British study done in the wake of the war noted of one German attack carried out in early 1916, believed to be a mix of chlorine and phosgene:  >Grass and other vegetation were turned yellow by the gas as far back as 1 ,200 yds. from the front line. Rats were killed in the trenches in large numbers. Eleven cows, twenty-three calves, one horse, one pig, and fifteen hens were  killed in the fields behind the lines by gas, and a number of other cattle and pigs showed signs of being affected by the gas.  Speaking of a different attack, a British officer described the image of the rats much more vividly when he wrote of what a gas attack did to them:  >The trenches swarmed with rats, big rats, small rats, grey rats, tall rats in every stage of gas poisoning! Some were sucrrying along scarcely affected while others were slowly dragging themselves about trying to find a corner in which to die. A most horrid sight - but very good riddance.  Good riddance indeed, as the rats were considered quite a scourge of the trench, and soldiers found that one of the few things that had *any* impact on their presence was the enemy, whether gas as above, or the explosions of artillery or grenades sending them scurrying away. It wasn't exactly a good trade-off, all in all though, since as made clear enough, even a gas attack could hardly be counted on to result in total lethality, and the ever common presence of heavenly conditions was sure to bring new rats in short order, likely a large contribution to literally millions of causalities in the war from the diseases they so easily spread.  After the war, men who had gained experience in chemical warfare in the war likely remembered the devastation that their weaponry had wrought on the local fauna, and in the 1920s attempts were made to 'pacify' gas warfare and introduce it as the newest way to protect crops from vermin and pests. The US Chemical Warfare Service conducted several tests in conjunction with the government on the promise that it offered \"the quickest and surest method in attacking crop destroying pests, whether ground squirrels, gopher, blackbird, crows, buzzard, rats, or grasshopper\".   Tests specifically aimed at rats were conducted in 1920 in the Gulf, in hopes of containing bubonic plague, and early reports claimed to be a rousing success with the use of a mixture of phosgene and chlorine gas. But testing in a contained 900 sq. foot area isn't the same as wide application, and the transition never was successfully made. Overall, such attempts to reapply chemical warfare to the civilian world showed that results were at best contained to the test conditions or short-lived, and in some cases quite counterproductive.  One attempt at tent caterpillar extermination found that it was killing the plants too. Other gasses were found to be ineffective, and the ones that worked best were of course the ones that were worst for humans as well. And the most desired target, the boll weevil, proved to be impervious to whatever was thrown its way as it simply could survive without breathing. Nevertheless it did help lay the groundwork for research that would eventually lead to more successful pesticides, even if not from the Chemical Warfare Service.  Now, as for lice, I would on the whole have to defer to someone else to note if there was any impact. I can make some guesses, but I wouldn't want to speculate. I would simply note that there is some very promising titled material in the National Archives which seem to be undigitized in the Records of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, especially \"*Report on Experiments Conducted on October 16, 1918, Testing the Effect of Certain Toxic Gases on Body Lice and Their Eggs*\" in Record Group 7.  **Sources**  Brantz, Dorothee. \"Environments of Death\" in *War and the Environment: Military Destruction in the Modern Age*, edited by Charles E.

Why is it that during the Victorian times, that suddenly changed and sex was deemed a very private affair? And why was homosexuality made illegal? Homosexuality was fine, then during the Victorian era it was considered worse than murder. During the 17th century people would have had sex in rooms with children present, whereas Victorians wouldn't even want to look at each other naked even when married. These days you're bigoted for being against homosexuality. What exactly is the reason for these changes? Why were the Victorians so different to previous time periods? Surely if they were told it was okay and natural, that would continue would it not?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " **Part I: Morality and the Victorian Family**  Someone else with expertise in that area will have to address the Ancient Greek side of things, but I can tackle the Victorians. Your question is based on a common misconception about the Victorian period, so I’m going to spend some time debunking that misconception and then try to explain why perfectly reasonable people believe it.   The Victorian period did not represent a sudden rupture from the past with regards to sexuality. Same sex desire and homosexuality and sex outside of marriage were taboo to differing degrees in different times and places in Western culture for centuries. The Victorians did not just up and decide that sex was bad outside of nowhere.   However, this is not to say that the Victorians didn’t differ from the generations immediately preceding them in some ways. One important development of the Victorian period was its heavy emphasis on domesticity. For the Victorians, the home and the family were paramount, the basis of the superior British civilization. The home was an oasis protected from the harsh outside world, a place of comfort where you can rest with your loved ones. Note that this ideal of the home and the family is not so different from how we as a culture think of homes and families today. However, for the Victorians, this idea of the home carried with it a hierarchy, with the husband and father as the head of house, the wife and mother as caretaker of the home (the \"Angel in the House,\" as one famous poem called it), both working to bring up well-adjusted, successful children.  Of course, people before the Victorians had homes and families and valued these things highly. The Victorians didn’t invent the family. What shifted was the importance of the family as a social category that needed to be protected and conceptions of public vs private life. On one hand, the nineteenth century saw, for respectable middle class people, the home was a private sphere, secluded from the world and with significantly more privacy within the home than had been available in previous centuries. Privacy has its own earlier history and development that other users can speak to better than me; for our purposes it’s enough to say that the domestic sphere was supposed to be private.   I say this with the caveat that I’m describing middle class people here; the working classes often lived in very different conditions. This cult of domesticity was very much a phenomenon of the middle class, who set themselves up as the upright, respectable contrast to the stereotypical image of the profligate and licentious aristocrat that had been promoted in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the rake or the libertine.   However, there is a contradiction in the Victorian family in that domesticity was also often the subject of public performance. We can argue that this phenomenon is reflected best at the top of society with Queen Victoria herself. Victoria navigated the contradiction of being a woman monarch. Women are supposed to be the Angel in the House, master of the private sphere, not involved in public life. To reconcile this, Victoria made a public performance of being the nation's exemplary mother—utterly devoted to her husband and many, many children. Victoria and Albert were a model of Victorian domestic life, but this model was also very publicly performed."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: AITA for accidentally putting a hit out on my best friend, imprisoning my wife, and not giving my sons every little thing they want? I (40M) and my wife (51F) have four sons(18, 16, 15, and 7) and three daughters (17, 11, and 8). I also have a son (21M) from a previous relationship. My wife brought substantial property into our marriage, and I want to keep as much of it as possible.   Until recently, my best friend (51?M), business partner and all-around confidante and partner-in-crime, had gotten along great. And then I decided to promote him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, thinking that things would stay the same. He and I would be as thick as thieves, and we could effectively rule England, Normandy, Anjou, Brittany and Aquitaine together, and everything would be great! We had previously been working to acquire more land and income for the English crown by leaving bishoprics vacant and collecting on the revenues, but as soon as he was named Archbishop, was suddenly not on my side anymore. He suddenly wanted secular clerks tried in church courts instead of secular courts, and declared that funds I had given him AS A LOAN were actually GIFTS! This is someone I trusted! I trusted him to educate my son and heir!   I tried to let him off easy. When I summoned the Bishops to Clarendon, I tried to give him a way out, and let him compromise, but he refused. I was forced to point out that his own spending as Chancellor was completely contrary to his current position on clerical spending practices. He was okay with it before I promoted him! And now that I've given him the status and power I thought he wanted, he's using it against me!!!   So anyways, he fled to France because obviously he couldn't defend himself against me. Then he goes and starts excommunicating my other advisers and some of my other bishops! Then he wrote to the Pope and they threatened to place all of England under interdict! Imagine that, no weddings, no absolution, no burials... I couldn't have that, so I had to negotiate with the bloody coward. Then, as he's returning to England, he excommunicates MORE of my Bishops! I was at dinner when I heard, so I said to the room \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric!\"   Now, I was just angry. Anybody who knows me, knows that I can get angry and that I say things I don't mean. But four of my knights, some of whom had worked for my late brother (28M), whose marriage to the richest single girl in England had been blocked by this meddlesome priest, went to Canterbury and murdered the Archbishop! I didn't ORDER them to do it. I didn't hold a sword to their throat and make them go do it. But people are saying it's my fault!   Now, three years later, after I did my penance, I thought everything was alright. I met a hot, younger woman (25F) and have been seeing her on the side since my wife is getting on in years and spends most of her time at her summer house in the South with our second son (16M). Now, our eldest (18M) keeps begging me for some estates of his own to govern. But he's irresponsible with money, and would rather fight in tournaments than learn the business of ruling. And my mother always said it was better to keep your falcons begging for scraps than to keep them well fed. So I keep telling him no. His older half-brother (21M) doesn't ask for anything!   But then I hear he's run off to his mother's place, and that they're all on their way to Paris to meet with my eldest son's father-in-law (who also happens to by my wife's ex-husband) to plot a war against me! They say that I have forfeited the crown when I had the Archbishop of Canterbury murdered! Again, I didn't order it. Some of my men captured my wife, and I have her imprisoned to make sure my sons behave, but I hear they're taking up arms against me and several of my nobles are following suit.  Did I put a hit out on my best friend? Is my wife mad about the other woman? Should I have given into my sons' constant requests for money? AITA?   TL;DR: My best friend betrayed me, and I got angry. Some of my men killed him in my name. My wife and sons are rebelling. AITA?   Edit: Oh, I also just got a message saying that the King of Scotland is invading too, great.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " YTA Look, Thomas Becket warned you that if you appointed him Archbishop, you and he would become bitter enemies. You can't act surprised that what he predicted came true. And it makes sense. You were friends with Becket because he was extremely competent and good at his job. He wasn't going to accept a promotion and start being corrupt and bad at his job, now was he?   The way that power works is that you have to act in ways that consolidate your power. As Chancellor, palling with the king, eating drinking and making merry, and wielding an iron fist in a velvet glove made Becket powerful, and made you like to hang out with him. Archbishops don't consolidate their power by doing those things. They consolidate their power by advancing the goals of the church against the crown, being all pious and boring, and using the church monies and influence for the goals of the church. By installing Becket into the position of Archbishop, you stuck a knife into the heart of your friendship.  Also, look, dude, you're the king of England, not some hillbilly running a Tiger zoo. You have to be careful with what you say. Plenty of people will want to butter you up any way they can, and if you keep talking about wanting someone dead, that person is liable to wind up dead. At the end of the day, the buck stops at your throne, and you have to take responsibility for what happens in your kingdom.  And by the way, your wife is a boss. She responded to the King of France divorcing her by marrying his rival, the King of England, and bringing her properties to the English crown. Tread carefully there, because she does not play to lose."

    "golden_answer": " Hooray!  this is something I can answer.  Partially...  In Europe, it was still clocks, belltower clocks.  The reason that there were so many belltowers in cities hundreds of years ago was that you couldn't afford a clock and you still needed to be places at a certain time, work, meetings social arrangements, exact time was becoming an issue, so you had clocks with bells on them, directing the pace of the cities.  At the more significant times, often more bells would ring.  Bells would stay silent during general sleeping hours.  Source: Boorstien's The Discoverers.  The other big answer, when exact time was less important was sunlight.  Leave your shutters, blinds, and curtains open.  Check when you wake up.  Blue spectrum shifted light occurs around sunrise and sunset, and wakes you up, this is why you may feel a bit drowsy at noon.

I'm Dr. Lindsay Chervinsky, here to discuss my new book 'The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution' and early Presidential history, AMA!  **The U.S. Constitution never established a presidential cabinet—the delegates to the Constitutional Convention explicitly rejected the idea. So how did George Washington create one of the most powerful bodies in the federal government?**  On November 26, 1791, George Washington convened his department secretaries—Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph—for the first cabinet meeting. Why did he wait two and a half years into his presidency to call his cabinet? Because the U.S. Constitution did not create or provide for such a body. Washington was on his own.  Faced with diplomatic crises, domestic insurrections, and constitutional challenges—and finding congressional help lacking—Washington decided he needed a group of advisors he could turn to. He modeled his new cabinet on the councils of war he had led as commander of the Continental Army. In the early days, the cabinet served at the president’s pleasure. Washington tinkered with its structure throughout his administration, at times calling regular meetings, at other times preferring written advice and individual discussions.  *The Cabinet* reveals the far-reaching consequences of Washington’s choice. The tensions in the cabinet between Hamilton and Jefferson heightened partisanship and contributed to the development of the first party system. And as Washington faced an increasingly recalcitrant Congress, he came to treat the cabinet as a private advisory body to summon as needed, greatly expanding the role of the president and the executive branch.\n\nAssistant:",

As a subject, this wasn’t brought up at all in my experience at school, and in general it isn’t talked about even comparably as often as the Holocaust is when it comes to historical atrocities. I find this hard to explain given conservative estimates of the death toll of Native American is said to be roughly 12 million according to Russell Thornton, and vary significantly with a toll of 100 million documented by D.E Stannard, author of ‘The American Holocaust’, the reasonable conclusion seems to land at around 75 million lives lost between Columbus’ arrival in 1492-1900, which works out to be close to 90% of the entire Native American population, with 5 million remaining today.

    "golden_answer": " Just to address this from a different perspective, ie why is the Holocaust considered unique, I will link to an answer by  u/commiespaceinvader to the question \"When people discuss the Holocaust, why do they focus mainly on the killing of the 6 million Jews?\"]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/564gvm/comment/d8g92dz/).  Specifically:  >\"In short the Western imagination of itself had experienced atrocities and horrors inflicted against political opponents, \"deviants\", and colonial subjects but it had never experienced that all it used to define itself as good and progressive – the modern state and its bureaucracy, industry, science, the police – was used to murder an entire group of European peoples.\"  It's old but I will also link to a [comment by u/400-rabbits on Stannard, which adds a bit of complexity - there are multiple historic Holocausts and they are all unique, if interrelated.  One thing I will add in addition to those answers is that when one is comparing the Holocaust to Indigenous peoples of the Americas, you're dealing with vastly different things in terms of time and scale - it's not just a numbers game. When we are talking about indigenous peoples of the Americas, we are discussing hundreds of different groups, who had very different experiences at the hands of different actors. Which is to say it makes it hard to talk about a singular \"genocide\" - the answer from u/EdHistory101 specifically focuses on the United States government in the 19th and 20th centuries, but that is part of a much larger history of conflict and dispossession of indigenous peoples lasting from the 1490s to literally this very moment, involving a vast array of actors. To be more comparable you'd probably need to compare the entire history of European anti-semitism from 1492 to the present.   The Holocaust itself is historically a much more concentrated event, involving one government as a prime mover (the NSDAP regime in Germany), which intentionally targeted Jews in Europe for industrialized mass killing, most of which took place over a three year period during the war (ETA a 2019 study found 25% of Holocaust victims were actually murdered in a three month period). Not only was this genocide extremely intentional and organized and planned to an exceptional level of detail, but Germany made it an overriding policy objective, even in its relations with friendly/allied countries - there were even low-level discussions between German and Japanese officials about the possibility of murdering the 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai (the Japanese refused).   However, even with that said I should point out via this thread that there is an ongoing historic debate at the moment as to how much white settlement of the Americas directly inspired Nazi policies and goals in Eastern Europe."

    "golden_answer": " History isn't always great at telling you \"how common\" something was across a whole country.  There were some hippies, and there were some squares as well.  However, the General Social Survey started in 1972.  I'm not going to go through the whole question list now (there are thousands questions, but it's searchable--however, not every question was asked every year), but it's all publicly available.  It's meant to be downloaded and used with a statistics package (like R, SPSS, Stata, which makes doing more complex things possible), but there is an online thing where you can mess around with it for free with no experience needed in statistics.  Okay, so on the right side you want Row: to be the variable you're interested in, for Column: put \"age\" (so you can separate \"young people\" from \"old people\"), and for Selection Filter(s) put \"year(1973)\" (or any year you want after 1972).  Two good variables to start with (remember, just type these in to \"Row:\") are GRASS (\"Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?\") and ANTIWAR (\"Have you ever taken part in.... (c) An anti-war demonstration?\").  Since I assume many of the readers are lazy, here's .jpegs of the output for 1973 for those two questions.  **Probably about 15-20% of young people in 1973 had participated in an anti-war protest, but probably about 35-50% thought that marijuana should be legal** (notice there's a lot of random variation in the numbers because we're dealing with small sample sizes).  To get at other questions (like attitudes towards sex), you can explore yourself.  I don't think they actually asked about drug use for a few more year but they might have already been asking at this point--there are a lot of questions to explore and I've mainly just used this to look at religion, and generally use this to look at the last 20 years, not the last 40.  You can play around with this.  For example, you can put \"year(1973-1978);age(18-25)\" under \"Selection Filter(s)\" if you want to just get a picture of \"young adults\" in the mid seventies.  Or you can search through the questions for ones about other topics you're interested in.  But honestly, though this is slightly after you're interested in (1973 instead of 1970), it's maybe the best place to get an idea of \"how common\" something was in that era."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why was marriage important to ancient and medieval alliances? Political alliances in large parts of the world during the ancient and medieval periods (and metal ages) were often sealed with marriages. I am struggling to understand why this was important - how does being married to someone's relative make a king less likely to attack them, or more likely to support them during a war? Especially during a period when women held little political power in their own right and a substantial portion of marriages were basically loveless?  Would these alliances have been weaker in the absence of a marriage? Why? Didn't people break them when convenient all the time anyway?  (I know the institution is different depending on region and age. Please, feel free to answer with regards to whichever historical periods you have the most familiarity with. I expect there are some common threads).  A similar question has been asked previously, but appears to be from before the current rules and standards on content moderation were put into effect. The answers have lots of good information, but didn't quite get to the heart of question.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " As /u/mimicofmodes and /u/somecrazynerd explained, alliances would absolutely be weaker without marriages. We in fact have people of the time tell us this: the Tokugawa, through marriage alliances, were able to grab enough allies to win control of Japan in 1600. So they included in their first set of laws issued in 1615 to all other daimyōs that there would be no marriages between warrior families without the Shōgun's approval (the Tokugawa themselves violated the same edict left in Hideyoshi's will). And in case someone important thought it didn't apply to them, in 1635 the law was clarified to include not only daimyōs but their immediate retainers and division heads. They were that scared marriage alliances would form power blocks to make a mess of things.  I would also like to add some things not mentioned in their great answers to the question linked above: the marriage also acted as a fantastic insurance policy.  First, if the alliance really were going to be broken, likely family correspondences would offer the earliest warnings. A famous, albeit apocryphal, story has Nobunaga's sister Oichi warning him his brother-in-law had betrayed him by sending Nobunaga a sack of beans tied up on both sides. While apocryphal, it's not improbable that Oichi did send Nobunaga some sort of warning. Even if not, we have another example Takeda Shingen's daughter-in-law was from the Imagawa clan. When Shingen decided he would backstab the Imagawa, his son supposedly plotted to assassinate him. Shingen had forced his son to divorce his daughter-in-law, strip his son of the position as heir to the clan, and execute a few ranking vassals. The poor young man was placed under house arrest for two years in a temple where he died. So while in this case the marriage alliance was not successful, consider the length to which the son was willing to defy his father to try to hold it together tells us the marriage definitely strengthened ties. Having no doubt heard about the entire thing and the death of his brother-in-law, the Imagawa daimyō requested Shingen send him back his sister, which Shingen complied. Only over a year later did Shingen invade the Imagawa. So the entire ordeal gave the Imagawa at least three years of warning. They still lost but it's not the marriage's fault.  Second, *even if* things do come to war with one side getting beat, your family/in-laws would likely offer mercy or beg for mercy on your behalf. In his rise to power in central Asia, Timor pardoned most Amirs whom he had a marriage alliance with but later came to blows. Likewise, in my area to use one of countless examples, the Hōjō clan went up against Hideyoshi and lost Hideyoshi basically ordered the clan's complete destruction, but the life of the final Hōjō daimyō Ujinao was spared because he was the son-in-law of Tokugawa Ieyasu as the Hōjō and the Tokugawa had a marriage alliance and Ieyasu begged for Ujinao's life to Hideyoshi. Ujinao's punishment was decreased to taking his buddhist vows to become a monk, and within a few years he was pardoned and became a daimyō again (albeit with a tiny fief).  Third, marriages themselves were insurance policies through the ties they create. In 1600 when the Mōri/Ishida side were going to war with the Tokugawa, the Sanada were caught in the middle because they had marriage alliances with both sides. What the Sanada did was decide to \"split\" in two, have a mock fight among themselves, and when the dust settled between the others the half that sided with the winners begged for mercy on behalf of the half that sided with the losers. In this case it was successful, but even if it wasn't at least half the family would have survived with their political powers intact (the winning half was given the realm of the loosing half, so no net change). And to be sure the Sanada weren't the only one to pull this trick.  Finally, even if all else fails, and the family is completely destroyed by the alliance breaking, hopefully the blood will live on through the son/daughter's offspring.  Note this is just about the strength of the alliance itself, and nothing about the familial ties and inheritance opportunities marriages create.  Also saying a substantial portion of marriages were loveless is likely a false modern bias. There are plenty of loveless marriages today and I see no proof there were proportionally more in history. Even if true, we have *plenty* of accounts and evidence of loving marriages."

I've taught a reasonable amount of Victorian and some Regency literature and have casually read a decent amount of non academic history of the Victorian and Regency eras. A common trope I've seen is of a rakish character or a spendthrift couple running up huge debts with various vendors (especially tailors) and basically just not paying. Sometimes the character is shown as dying in penury but at other times they just seem to carry on in the same style as always, just ignoring or stringing along the vendors who provide their goods and services. What's more this seems to be seen as if not typical at least not unusual.  Was this sort of casual attitude toward payment for goods and services on the part of the upper classes an actual thing?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " As a small business owner, you would have recourse for dealing with deadbeat customers. A guy like Pip or Rawdon Crawley wouldn't be allowed to fleece you forever, unless you let them--and if Sir Richard Dastardly was rich enough, sometimes you would just let it slide for a little bit. If they \"paid you in exposure\" and sent their (possibly more solvent) friends to you to buy suits or dresses, you might let it slide for a little while, just to be neighborly and keep the peace. But if you were doing House of Worth work for pawnshop pay, you'd eventually get fed up. You'd start sending duns/debt collectors to knock on their door, hoping the annoyance and potential shame would convince them to pony up. At this point, he might contract with a moneylender for a promissory note; the lender would pay you and charge Dastardly interest, and Dastardly would be out of your hair.  If your debtor doesn't find a way to pay you, your next step is prosecution. You want Sir Richard to actually show up for the trial, so you bring legal action against him and pay a shilling for an arrest warrant. A sheriff's officer serves the warrant and will take Sir Richard Dastardly to a sponging house. There, you have some time to settle or you'll end up on trial/in jail.  If it gets to trial, and Dastardly is found to be a debtor, they stick him in jail. You can't just take his stuff, however, not yet -- he still has to decide to pay you, by selling his own stuff or borrowing money from family and friends. Rawdon Crawley never gets to this point, but a number of Dickens characters did. Usually, if you ended up in debtor's prison, you were already poor--not a Sir Richard Dastardly. Typically, a person with a title would have resources: they could sell land, a horse, beg Auntie for cash, or marry some wealthy heiress. If you were poor and in debtor's prison, you did have some light at the end of the tunnel: you could still ply certain trades from within prison, and you could eventually hope to get out. But it was miserable and difficult to drag oneself out of that debt hole. (Imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1869.)  Now, as to your question, \"Did they care?\" I think they cared about as much as we do. Victorians were a little more moralistic than we are now in that they were generally more likely to judge their neighbors as \"bad\" than put the circumstance ahead of their judgment -- but a lot of their attitudes are similar to today's. Being a serial debtor was more personal to the Victorians than it is to us, because there were, with the possible exception of the East India Company, no giant faceless monolithic companies to which you would owe money. You'd owe money to Bob the tailor and Joe the greengrocer, guys who lived probably within a few miles' radius of your own house, not to MasterCard. No one goes hungry if you don't pay MasterCard, but a Victorian person refusing to make good on his debts was literally taking money away from his neighbors, which was a bad look. Tongues would start wagging when the debt collectors came knocking, and a Sir Richard type might find himself not invited to as many parties as before. If he had romantic prospects, they could dry up: the father of a young lady isn't going to want his daughter hooking up with a spendthrift who'll end up in prison and will be unable or unwilling to provide for his family. If he's part of a gentleman's club, depending on how bad his money woes are (and whether or not all the other men in his club have similar attitudes towards money), he could find himself kicked out.   There were jerks, con men, liars, and people who had \"f-you\" amounts of money where they could gleefully skip town on Bob the Tailor and not care. There were no credit scores in the time period, but all you had was your name. If you developed a reputation as a sketchball, tailors wouldn't want to do work for you on credit anymore--no matter who you were. Tailors for the most part couldn't afford to give their work away for free. You'd have to pay cash. If you had cash, this wouldn't actually be a big deal, which is why a lot of wealthier people might only care about their debts insofar as their reputation could be affected. If Bob didn't want to play ball anymore, they'd just pay Bob the cash and get credit from some other poor slob. If you didn't have cash, this would be a serious issue for you. Some \"wealthy\" people didn't actually have \"ready money,\" only large fixed assets like land or houses, which they would then have to mortgage or sell if they'd tanked their reputation/credit, or who were known to be out of money even if they'd never had a debt problem. Like today, a lot of \"rich people\" were cash-poor, and kept an appearance of wealth by leveraging what they did have to get more.  (Sources I looked at to write this: \"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew,\" by Daniel Pool; \"The Victorian City\" by Judith Flanders; \"Vanity Fair\" by William Makepeace Thackeray.)  EDIT: I corrected the naming. While “Sir Dastardly” sounded like a very interesting person to me, and is more descriptive of his character, the commenter below is right—it’s Sir Richard (Sir Dick if ya nasty)."

If such an expedition did happen, what would the Malian ships have looked like? I'm not so much asking about the veracity of the story here; I understand that we have virtually no records about it and aren't even sure of the identity of the mansa in question. However, I've had a hard time learning much about any West African ships of the time beyond river canoes that seem ill-suited to even think of going out in to open ocean (though that's \"seem ill-suited\" to my eye, which is very much an ignorant one on the matter of sailing). If any exploration of the Atlantic was conducted by Mali around this time, what would the ships be like?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The Mali Empire was primarily concentrated along the highlands of Mandeland (located in contemporary Republic of Guinea and southern Republic of Mali) and along the Niger River Valley, with its downstream border being somewhere between the cities of Kawkaw (modern Gao) and Kukiya (modern Bentiya). At its heyday, the Mali reached the distant lands of some saharan cities (like Walata, Essouk/Tadmakka and Takedda) all the way to the Atlantic Coast, between the Senegal and Gambia rivers.     With that data in mind, we can proceed to investigate the watercourses the Malians would be familiar with and figure out the boats they used to navigate them. Namely, they were familiar with the slow waters of major rivers (Niger, Senegal and Gambia) and with the coast of modern day Senegambia. Sadly, we lack direct sources about what types of boats were available at that time (14th century) in that particular area (River valleys and Senegambian coast). However, we do have a lot of accounts from european traders from the 16th century onwards, and those are quite useful.     European traders, sailing along the Senegambian coast, quickly found africans (wolofs, serers, mandinkas, bizagos and others) using canoes - some quite large, that could transport cattle - to navigate the ocean. Those canoes lacked sails and depended on the strength of rowers to get somewhere. The fact that the Cape Verde islands (about 600 kilometers from the coast) were uninhabited prior to the arrival of european sailors is strong evidence that the local african canoes didn't get very far into the open sea, prefering coastal areas.     Those canoes were mostly made out a single tree and quite effective at their purpose (i.e. navigate around the coast and into river estuaries), but sometimes more diverse materials would be used.     In the larger and calmer rivers inland, canoes were used as well, but also bigger boats made out of several pieces of wood, capable of carrying lots of people and animals. They, however, also lacked proper sails and relied on people (either rowing or pushing against the riverbed with paddles) or simply the gentle currents of the river.     TL;DR: Basically canoes and boats that lacked sails and, despite their occasional large size, lacked the proper resistance to sustain damage caused by waves or fight sea currents. They wouldn't get far and, in the odd occasion that they did, the boats would be at the mercy of the ocean."

    "golden_answer": " Tl;dr: OP probably overestimates the importance of the alleged practice of *holmgang* (dueling) in the judicial process or the settlement of conflict in general in Viking Age and medieval Scandinavia.   +++  Sorry for the really, really late response.   >......during the height of Danish raiding in the west    Sorry again, I'm not sure about when OP exactly means to specify alone in this sentence.   In the late 9th century? Or, around the turn of the millennium (so-called \"Late/ Second Viking Age)?    If the former is indeed the case, the situation would have been much closer to that of Iceland, discussed by /u/glasgallow and linked by /u/BookQueen13 below. It was not until the middle of the 10th century that now Denmark saw somewhat stable, unified (and supra-local) polity in form of Jelling dynasty after the collapse of the Godfred-Horik dynasty around the middle of the 9th century.     On the other hand, if OP ('s supposed war veteran) lived under the reigns of the Jelling rulers like Svend Forkbeard or Cnut the Great, he (as a war veteran, I primarily regard the Dane in question as \"him\" in order not to go into the details on the woman's legal capacity in Viking Age and Medieval Danish laws) might get interfered by the superior authority beyond the local society level like these kings.    Another possibly (and most probably) problematic premise in OP's question is the assumption that he the Dane ex-Viking] could use press his claim by resorting almost solely to the practice of *holmgang* with ease there either in the late 9th century or in the 10/11th centuries.    The study of conflict settlement in medieval Europe (including Scandinavia and Iceland) has advanced greatly especially since 1970s, with help of the anthropological approach as well as feud study, initiated early in the 20th century by Otto Brunner. From their point of view, the use of violence and the judicial process were not dichotomous (mutually exclusive), but often complemented each other to reach an agreement between both parties involved with - that now we regard as an primary goal of a series of conflicts.    As for the social meaning of not unlimited/ ritual use of violence in early medieval society (though not in Viking Age Scandinavia in a narrow sense), I also recommend you to check /u/EndOfTheWorldGuy's recent post in: [Was the need to go to great lengths to defend ones honor as vain as we perceive it today in our modern times? How important was it to gain and protect honor besides the obvious reasons of ego?.   Another trend since 1970s that has affected the alleged importance of *holmgang*, or the legal text recorded later on medieval parchments in general, is a revisionism in the character of medieval Scandinavian law books (codes). These law texts had often been regarded as a residue (or at least including residue layer) of the Viking Age society and sometimes used for the comparative analysis to reconstruct the distant past, but now more and more scholars got used to analyze them primarily as the product of a social change in later times, especially the High Middle Ages when these texts were codified (, though a few scholars has countered this revisionist trend further now).   The majority of study on the *holmgang* had been published until 1970s - thus belonged to the older (now dated) approach of conflict settlement as well as the legal culture of the Viking Age Scandinavia. In other words, less and less scholars are now not so sure about the possibility that Viking Age Scandinavians actually practiced *holmgang* to settle the conflict widely, exact as specified in one of High Medieval Swedish lawbooks as well as some sagas of the Icelanders.   Aside from these two changing trend of research as well as the essential primary texts, however, we mainly have two more problems to take OP's case into consideration:    1. As Vogt remarks, we have not so ideal- or very limited amount of primary sources for the study on the judicial practice in Medieval Denmark. Almost no court record is extant until the end of the 14th century, and almost no record of judgement for whole the Middle Ages (prior to the Reformation in Denmark in 1536) (Vogt 2014: 185f.).   1. While medieval Danes almost certainly knew the concept of *holmgang* itself, we rely mainly on one specific person - Saxo Grammaticus for Viking Age Denmark. 13th century lawbooks don't explicitly refer to the *holmgang* as a judicial practice at all.    +++    Then, what Saxo (about 1200) says about the *holmgang*, or exactly speaking, its abolition?    Saxo mentions duels across the first half of his work (legendary pre-history part), but not so much in his latter, history (10th/ 11th century onward) part. He actually mentions its abolition twice, in somewhat contradictory manners:    1. At the time of conversion of King Svend Forkbeard by Poppo's ordeal (around the turn of the millennium) (Saxo, X-xl-4, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 21): \".....The Danes abolished the custom of judicial duelling, and that decreed that various cases should be settled by this kind of ordeal.\"   1. For the second time, Saxo ascribes the total eradication of the practice of judicial combats under the reign of King Harald Hen (r. 1074/76-80), as he comments as following (Saxo XI-x-7, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 72): \"For it seems to posterity that law-disputes are better settled by swearing than by steel.\"    For me, these accounts suggest that Saxo certainly regarded the trial \"by steel\" (judicial combat) somewhat as archaic way of settlement, but we cannot know the details of former practices only based on these accounts alone.    +++    Provincial codes from the 13th century generally specify the testimony with oath by the respected person in the district as a means to settle the problem, and I wonder whether similar way could have also been taken before in some cases.   To give an example, *The Law of Jutland (1241 CE)* stipulates on the boundaries between the field as following:    >\"If men disagree about boundaries between fields, then men of truth of the district shall mark it with stakes or with stones and thereafter swear at that place where there is disagreement that they have done it rightly. If it is both on the boundary between fields and between districts that they disagree, then four from one district and four from the other districts, those that live closest, shall decide and swear according to what they know most truthfully they have done it right, and then make it public at the assembly. But if there is any memory that it had been sworn to before, and any man is alive of those who swore, then it shall not be sworn to again. But if there is no memory that it had been sworn to before, and the king will have the boundaries settled by riding, then it will also fully stand; however, he must not come without notice so that it is secret to some of those who are parties in the dispute. It is safer that the boundary between the fields be sworn to than ridden, the those know best who live the closest.....(*The Law of Jutland*, II-21, English translation is taken from: [Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 261f.].\"     If similar system was applied to the conflict settlement for OP's case, the personal connection either with local or with the external political authority must have played an important role - since the king should also appoint \"men of truth\" (*The Law of Jutland*, II-1~4, Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 258). Before the royal appoint became norm, it is also likely that such a role should have been played by the local elders or possibly the chieftain (perhaps on behalf of the king).      +++    On the other hand, surprisingly enough, it was not until the almost end of the Middle Ages that not only the nobles, but also the peasants sometimes employ the violence as a means to push their claim against their peers (that is to say, peasant vs peasant) in medieval kingdom of Denmark. Denmark did not have a unified kingdom-wide law code like Norway, and the monopoly of violence by the kingship did not easily achieved in practice, researchars argues.    There have been some excellent scholarships on such \"bondefejde\", so if OP can read Danish, [Fenger 1971] can be recommended as the classic of the topic.

    "golden_answer": " I think for most of us in the West, it's easy to slip into seeing \"colonize and evangelize\" as the default setting. Our Western Civ II/World Civ II class *starts* with that as the foundational principle in its triumphant Story Of Civilization. In fact, with a variety of exceptions, Christianity and Islam had spent a solid number of centuries quite comfortably expanding through attrition in conquered territories. The ideal of evangelizing militancy in what John O'Malley has dubbed \"Early Modern Catholicism\" is exceptional--not the other way around. And to a much greater extent than our textbooks like to admit, *successful* militant evangelization was an even further exception.  Christian Europeans had spent the fifteenth century making, well, European Christianity. It was the Church's first full-court press to teach *everyone* in Christian society the basic fundamentals of what now had a name: \"the Christian faith.\" That's not to overblow the 14th century as \"pagan\" or whatever, just to stress how *dedicated* large swathes of the 15th century Church were to religious instruction of the laity. The Ten Commandments, the seven deadly sins, the meaning of the sacraments, how to die a good death so you go to heaven, reading the Bible (in the vernacular...except in England) to your family after a post-Mass meal, &c.  Individual-level religious enthusiasm is a big part of this in many cases, from leaders on down. It was especially aided by an utterly ubiquitous belief that the world was going to end RIGHT NOW...no, NOW...no, but that's *definitely* the Antichrist over there. It makes the looming Day of Judgment very real and very soon. It's easy to bleed this over into *collective* religious enthusiasm--the desire to save other people's souls, too.  There are other factors in play, especially the inexorable onward march of the medieval push towards order in society. Sumptuary laws regulating what people of different social statuses are and aren't allowed to wear is a very visible example. Religion is another big one, though. You'll recall that other thing that happened in 1492--Isabella and Ferdinand forced all Jewish Spaniards to choose between conversion to Christianity or immediate exile. This isn't *just* anti-Semitism for the sake of anti-Semitism, although it's that too; subsequent actions of Spanish inquisitors put in action the often-stated paranoia that Jewish people will sneakily de-convert New Christians. A big threat to Church and state authority!  So we head into the sixteenth century with Western Europe tipping into *internal* militant evangelization. You can then think of Martin Luther and his rinkadink regional Reformation as one among many contemporary reform movements. Several of those being, as traditional in medieval Christianity, *reformacio* of monastic life. Most relevantly here, that means the creation of the Jesuits and Ursulines, and the streamlining and outward turn of Observant mendicant orders. In addition to personal, internal spiritual renewal, the new and revived orders aimed to really, REALLY get Christians to be, well, Christian, and in a more sober and knowledgeable way than some of the more colorful aspects of late medieval devotion.  *Now* we can pitch this into wider context. The Church had long seen itself as an international government, operating within and beyond secular ones. Participation in colonialist expansion to the west and south and very east was important to it for mundane reasons as well as spiritual ones. One strategy absolutely was to plant convents of European nuns (especially) and monks as a way of claiming territory. But the other was to try to convert Indigenous populations to Christianity as an extension of the way Europe was being \"converted.\"  And that's the happy triumphant success narrative, and we point to modern Mexican Catholicism and the recent canonization of Kateri Tekakwitha and say, \"Sounds plausible.\" In reality, there were a whole lot of jagged steps forwards and backwards. You're probably familiar with That Ugly Time Europeans Decided To Formally Debate Whether Indigenous Americans Are Human, a question intimately wrapped up with whether they should be targets for conversion or not.   In some cases, Christianity blended into native religion and native religion blended into Christianity. Sometimes this *didn't* happen, and colonialist Inquisitors thought it had anyway and persecuted Americans for witchcraft. In Catholic Europe, meanwhile, the Inquisition was frequently targeting people it identified as \"crypto-Jews\"--essentially, people they believed were adopting a veneer of Christianity while retaining their non-Christian religion for keeps. We're talking about an Early Modern Catholicism here, not mission versus home Christianity. And sometimes, friars kind of just shrugged and said maybe mission wasn't really that important to the Church in the first place.  European imperialist expansion happened at a very specific time in western religious history. To be a Christian had become *defined as* more than just baptism and reciting the right words at your godchildren's baptisms; making a territory Christian needed to mean more than mass baptism or even baptism of the leaders. Whether imperialist conquest, diplomatic encounter (hi, China!), or cleaning up one's own backyard, the making of Christians was of primary importance to large segments of the Catholic Church.  They had the money, the power, and the government support in the interests of order and control to back up their mission of saving souls with the apocalypse just over the horizon."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Some states have legalized marijuana and are now having to make decisions about how to handle people in jail for marijuana convictions. What happened to moonshiners, rum runners & other intemperate folks in jail when Prohibition ended in 1933?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " PART I  To start, unless they were prosecuted after 1929 they probably wouldn't have been there in the first place.  Let's go back a decade to explain why this was the case.  The Volstead Act - the legislation providing the nominal teeth to provide a method to enforce Prohibition on the federal level - had a structural weakness that essentially doomed it from the start even if everything else surrounding Prohibition had worked: it required jury trials.  To say this overwhelmed the Federal Court system and made punishment under Volstead laughable doesn't even come close.  From Daniel Okrent:  >\"One of the nobler aspects of the Volstead Act was its guarantee of the right to a jury trial for anyone charged with a violation. It was a requirement, it soon turned out, that the legal system was incapable of handling...Mabel Willebrandt [one of the most aggressive prosecutors of Prohibition] acknowledged that “juries will not convict if the punishment does not fit the crime,” and she was proven right in city after city, as juries effectively nullified the law because they didn’t think any punishment at all was appropriate for breaking the liquor laws. After Smedley Butler was fired as director of public safety in Philadelphia, he offered a statistic that was simultaneously a boast and an admission of defeat: in two years, his police force had made 227,000 liquor violation arrests. To Old Gimlet Eye, this indicated that his men had nabbed 15 percent of the city’s population; to anyone else, it indicated that they had arrested the same people over and over and over again.  Or as one district judge in New York put it to a Prohibition violator in the mid 1920s, \"You have been brought before me twelve times in twelve months for violations of the Volstead Act. What do you have to say?\" His reply: \"Your Honor, I can't help it if you're not promoted.\"  This led to what was essentially chaos in the court system for a decade, especially since Dry advocates used conviction numbers as a brute force yardstick to measure prosecutorial effectiveness; the Southern District US attorney in New York was expected to clear 10,000 cases annually.  >\"Proceedings were conducted without court stenographers or clerks. Six judges and one magistrate were expected to dispose of fifty thousand cases annually. Even if each had worked full time on nothing but Volstead cases, together they would have been able to handle fewer than four thousand a year—and had they done that, no other federal matter would have been adjudicated anywhere in the district, which stretched all the way to Albany...by one accounting, U.S. attorneys across the country spent, at minimum, 44 percent of their time and resources on Prohibition prosecutions—if that was the word for the pallid efforts they were able to sustain on such limited resources. In North Carolina and West Virginia, the federal prosecutors devoted 70 percent of their time to Prohibition violations; in Minnesota, 60 percent; in southern Alabama—where Mabel Willebrandt would directly supervise one of the most aggressive enforcement efforts in the nation—Volstead prosecutions consumed a staggering 90 percent of the federal docket.\"  What this led to in turn was a shortcut: the vast majority of cases - which were misdemeanors anyway - were plea bargained out for a guilty verdict and a nominal fine, and if you were crazy enough to actually bring something to a jury trial, then as one prosecutor put it, \"The fixers, he said, were found even in the men’s rooms, attempting to bribe jurors hearing those few cases that made it to trial. In the courtrooms crooked lawyers encouraged perjury.\"  In addition given the terrible training and miniscule expenditure on Prohibition Agents - presuming they weren't already felons when they signed up, where by 1930 almost 10% had been fired for lying on their applications for previous convictions, which doesn't even begin to cover those taking bribes - the police work was generally terrible and the courts often had field days with fourth amendment violations, and had legal implications that still exist today.  Last but not least, at the beginning of the 1920s there were a grand total of three federal prisons throughout the country - so where exactly were you going to put all the miscreants?  So this led to such scenes as \"thousands of Volstead violators were...(delivered) by the wagonful to the badly degraded Federal Court in downtown Manhattan. This led the (US attorney for the region) to concoct an opportunity that quickly became known as “Bargain Day.” Publicly promising to request light fines in exchange for guilty pleas, he invited defendants to the Old Post Office Building south of City Hall, where his staff, working with two cooperative federal judges, could process five hundred cases at a time and clear up the backlog.\"  While the fines were often small, usually ranging between $5-$250 (the former for consumers, the latter viewed as a cost of doing business by the providers), the numbers added up: in the Northern District of New York, in 1925 and 1926 a single judge assessed $2.5 million in fines for Volstead violations, or the better part of $40 million today.  Incidentally, this is one reason my second favorite scene of *Boardwalk Empire* (the first being Nucky Thompson declaring 'that imbicile is going to be the next President of the United States!' when he hears Harding has received the nomination) is the one in which the Mabel Willebrand-inspired prosecutor is shocked to discover she finally has a shot at Nucky in court and attempts to throw the book at him - and the exhausted judge working at 2 am looks for 10 seconds at the evidence he's actually arrested for and fines him something like $5.  While the scene is of course entirely fictional, it's also a decently accurate representation of the general futility of Volstead era prosecutions; in fact, one of the few judges who decided to actually try to enforce the law as intended and who had used sightseeing buses to round up prisoners actually went insane after two years of doing so and ended up killing himself.  But that was just in Federal Court.  One of the nuttier aspects of the Eighteenth Amendment was that it allowed concurrent jurisdiction between the Feds and the States with the expectation by the Drys that State governments would step up.  As you'd expect, this didn't quite work out uniformly.  From Okrent again:  >The peculiar second clause of the Eighteenth Amendment, assigning “concurrent” enforcement power to the federal government and to the states, mandated (or at least encouraged) armies of cops across the nation to stand shoulder to shoulder in the booze wars. The relative strength of the Anti-Saloon League in various parts of the country could be measured by the proliferation of state laws designed to be “concurrent” with the federal strictures. Anyone arrested for insobriety in Vermont was subject to a mandatory jail sentence if he failed to name the person from whom he acquired his liquor. At one point Indiana vested train conductors and bus drivers with the authority to arrest passengers carrying alcohol and made it illegal for retailers to put flasks or cocktail shakers in their shop windows. Mississippi decreed debts related to the acquisition of intoxicating beverages uncollectible. Iowa banned the sale of Sterno, from which alcohol could be extracted by filtering it through a rag or, among drunks with better table manners, through a loaf of bread...only eighteen states bothered to appropriate as much as a dollar for enforcement. In some jurisdictions this reflected a distaste for the whole business; New York repealed its state enforcement code in 1923, and Maryland never even bothered to enact one.  One great example of just how even true believers were restricted comes from Pennsylvania, where Gifford Pinchot - the legendary founder of the Park Service - got himself elected Governor on a Dry Platform.  >In his first month in office he turned the state police into a commando army. A single week saw raids on illegal liquor operations in eighteen counties. Reminding Republican legislators that he was now head of the party, that he had led them to victory at the top of the ticket in November, and that they had pledged their support to his legislative program, Pinchot got all the laws he wanted. Swollen with the pride of a triumphalist, gleaming with the righteousness of a reformer, Pinchot announced that he had achieved his legislative success without making a single promise in exchange for a vote. “This is an unbought victory,” he proclaimed, “and ten times as valuable on that account.”  Unbought, perhaps, but unfunded as well. After Pinchot’s glorious moment had passed, the legislators who had gone along with his program stiffened. It was one thing for the Pennsylvania legislature—any legislature, really—to give militant drys the laws they wanted, but quite another to provide the funds necessary for their enforcement. As a result, the legislators decided that the total appropriation for Pinchot’s ambitious program should amount to precisely...zero."

    "golden_answer": " There's evidence of 'factionalism' even among the earliest Christians (in the 1st century) on this very issue. In many cases, much of the tension arose between Jewish and Gentile Christians. But not necessarily. One of the narratives in the New Testament itself that addresses dietary issues (and some of the Christian innovations regarding them) is found in the 10th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:  >Peter went up on the roof to pray. 10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 11 He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air. 13 Then he heard a voice saying, \"Get up, Peter; kill and eat.\" 14 But Peter said, \"By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean.\" 15 The voice said to him again, a second time, \"What God has made clean, you must not call profane.\"   This is almost certainly more representative of the so-called \"supersessionist\" branch, which prioritized the coming/sacrifice of Christ and its transformative effects over observance of Jewish law.  We can see another narrative that addresses kosher/dietary things, just a few chapters later (in Acts 15). Described here is a \"council\" in Jerusalem, with many the most important Christian figures present: James, Peter, Paul. In the end, these figures produce a letter which is then sent to Gentiles churches, advising that Gentiles should \"abstain . . . from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.\" This list is virtually identical to that in Leviticus 17-18: prohibiting meat offered to idols (17.8-9), ingestion of blood (17.10-12) and improperly slaughtered animals (17.15).  I've written about this in more detail here - but just to pick out one little section:  >there's no real indication from [the council related in Acts 15] that Paul and the Jerusalem church get along anything other than splendidly (\"our dear friend\" Paul, etc.) . . . Yet the letter that they then send back with Paul (to Antioch, Syria, Cilicia) seems to have \"agreements\" which, elsewhere, are quite opposed by Paul. While - for the sake of space - skipping over some nuances here, consider Paul's blanket statement in 1 Cor 10:25-26:  >>Eat *anything* that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’s sake; \"for the earth is the Lord's, and all it contains\"  ____  Ultimately, as the Christian church became a majority *Gentile* church, the supersessionist 'faction' won out - evidence of which is certainly found in the accounts of Acts themselves (which, as a whole, is a highly fictionalized [quasi-]'history').   It's absolutely fascinating to look at early Islam's relationship with all this. There's some evidence that some of the influence of some of the more primitive Jewish-oriented Christian sects survived, and may have still been around to have influenced Islam (that could be its own thread). But in any case, it all fits in with Islam's portrait of a Christianity which - though still founded by figures that were truly divinely inspired, and worth of reverence - had gone too far in its rejection of the laws and theology of its 'mother' traditions, introducing heretical innovations."

    "golden_answer": " >How did that belief change into the modern view that people who die and go to heaven will stay in heaven eternally?  Both beliefs have existed simultaneously since ancient times and survive today. Let's start with a look into the origin of the former. When the Israelites were exiled from Palestine by Babylon in the 6th century BCE, returning to that land became a major theme in their scriptures. This is the purpose of Ezekiel's vision of the Valley Of Dry Bones, in which God shows the prophet many dead bodies being returned to their living state and explains that Israel will be restored just so.   After the exile, many exilic biblical passages were reinterpreted as Israel's historical context changed, and in the face of oppression many Jews began to view Ezekiel's vision as a prophecy of a literal, bodily resurrection at the end of time, divine justice for the suffering they faced in life. We see this view in the book of 2 Maccabees (which FYI isn't considered canon by protestants) written in the second century BCE. The author recounts the oppression the Jews faced under the brutal Antiochus Epiphanes, who outlawed Jewish practices under pain of death. In the story, a mother and her seven sons bravely choose to be burned alive rather than renounce their faith, comforted by the knowledge that they will be resurrected to eternal life while Antiochus and his men rot in the ground.   A few centuries later we see a retelling of the same event in the book of 4 Maccabees, but this time the family is reassured not that they will be bodily resurrected, but that their souls will be immediately gathered to God, and that  >We, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, on whose account we suffer; but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire. (4 Mac 9:8-9)  For this author it is the soul that matters rather than the body, and since God is eternal, so is his judgment, immediate and everlasting. (The irony of the influence of Platonic philosophy on this author's account of a resistance against Greek culture is apparently lost on him.)   The persecution under Antiochus is the same situation that gave rise to apocalyptic literature like the book of Daniel (2nd century BCE), in which the author assures his reader that God will send \"one like a son of man\" to bring divine destruction onto the ruler and usher in the bodily resurrection and judgment immediately after his death (Daniel 11:45-12:2). The early Christians adapted this framework to Jesus. They believed he was Daniel's \"son of man\" who intervened to conquer death and sin and that his resurrection was the \"first fruits\" of the general resurrection soon to come (1 Corinthians 15:20).  Many believers changed their minds from belief in the resurrection to the belief in immediate spiritual judgment simply because God's physical intervention into history (known as the Kingdom Of God) and ushering in of the resurrection never came. We can see this even in the gospel of Luke, when Jesus tells the man being crucified next to him \"today you will be with me in Paradise.\" The evangelist even tells his readers not to expect the Kingdom Of God to come, but rather know that it resides inside them (Luke 17:21). Compare this to the other gospels in which Jesus assures his followers that the earthly Kingdom Of God is soon to come indeed (Matthew 24:30-34).  Plenty of Christians today believe in a synthesis of both immediate spiritual judgment and a bodily resurrection at the end of time. This belief goes back to the book of 4 Ezra, in which the eponymous Israelite leader is told by an angel that spiritual torment and paradise begin immediately after death, but that there is also a coming bodily resurrection, at which point the righteous will enjoy everlasting life and the wicked will finally be destroyed forever.

    "golden_answer": " Yes, absolutely.  To begin with, don't forget that the romanticized Western image of samurai as hyper honor focused warrior monk types is pure exoticism with no real historic backing.   More to the point, like with the knights of Europe, while there was an official ideal of honor it was more prescriptive than descriptive and when you have a large group of heavily armed men some are going to be scumbags.  Further, \"samurai\" simply meant \"person from the caste permitted to carry weapons\", towards the end of the Tokugawa period (1600-1868) a great many samurai class men had no real weapon training, a minimal pension from the government, and generally survived by running up debts which were nullified every few years by government edict.   The Seven Samurai takes place earlier, in the Sengoku period (aka the Warring States Period), at a time of chaos and general confusion.  There was no centralized government, no rule beyond what the local warlord decreed and could enforce, and samurai (again, meaning \"people who carried weapons\", not \"super highly trained and deeply honorable warrior monk types\") were thugs enforcing the will of their local warlord, which usually meant stealing whatever they could from the peasants and calling it taxes.  Or, worse, they were ronin.  When a warlord was defeated his soldiers (samurai) often just wandered off and turned to banditry to survive. There's a lot of mythology and several stories involving deeply honorable ronin seeking adventure and vengeance for the people who betrayed their lords, but mostly in real life they were just armed and trained men who took whatever they could from the people least likely to fight back.  You might check out State of War, it's more about the somewhat earlier times than the Sengoku period, but most of what it covers applies to the later periods as well.  For an interesting, often funny, first hand, primary source, account of daily life for a poor man of samurai class during the mid Tokugawa period check Musui's Story, it's a very quick read, an autobiography written by Musui himself, who lived a quite disreputable life and busts a lot of myths of the noble honorable samurai.  TL;DR: even at the best of times, samurai were just soldiers, and historically soldiers weren't what you'd call very nice.  In the worse times they were just bandits.  The idea of samurai as super honorable warriors is just a myth."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: suppose I live in Boston in 1717. How far would have to travel to find a Native American tribe who have had no direct contact with white people in living memory?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I'll assume living memory to be a nice round number like 60, so we are looking for the closest Native American nation that did not have direct contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717. I'll also assume that not all members of the group interacted with Europeans, just that somewhat regular contact/influence existed some time between 1657 and 1717.  The closest nations to Boston, the Wampanoag, Nipmuck, Narragansett and Nashaway, were swept up in the hostilities with King Phillip's War from 1675-1678. Any Native American belligerents not killed in the conflict and not professing Christians were sold into slavery in Bermuda. Praying Indians settled in towns like Natick, Grafton and Marlborough, and refugees fled inland to join other nations.  Expanding out of the direct Boston/Providence Plantation area, we have the nations in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Coastal populations in Maine would have regular trading contact with white merchants and fisherman, so those nations are out. Further inland many nations possibly contacted a European during King William's War (look, a map] during the 1680s and 1690s. I am not as familiar with the small nations of northern Maine, but I assume the constant tension between the French and English colonial enterprises, and the Maine Amerindians strategic importance as allies, meant they were courted extensively during the period. Further north into Canada the Wendat/Huron were strongly allied with the French, and during the diaspora caused by the Beaver Wars (to be explained shortly) fled west to the Great Lakes.  Looking west, here is a generalized map so we can keep our bearings. The Mahican and the Delaware definitely encountered Europeans in the period of interest. First contact along the Mohawk River occurred in 1609 and these groups were intimately involved in the game of colonial expansion with New York/New England/New France.   1657-1717 is a very interesting time for the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois. Hostilities related to the fur trade and disease mortality brought about a series of mourning wars that increased the Haudenosaunee territory, and wrought destruction over a huge swath of the U.S. Midwest. The Beaver Wars turned the Great Lakes into a war zone. Iroquois raids depopulated much of the U.S. Midwest and sent refugees fleeing to the lands bordering the Great Plains. French missionaries fled west with their Huron flock, establishing missions on Lake Michigan by 1652 and the western tip of Lake Superior by 1661. As they moved west, the Huron diaspora opened up the fur trade to nations previously beyond the frontier outposts. Heading directly west of Boston we are basically on the Great Plains before we consider a nation without European contact.  Next, lets dive south. English colonial enterprises in Pennsylvania contacted the Erie, Shawnee and previously mentioned Iroquois. Jamestown was established in 1607, and English influence continued to grow among the Algonquian nations living in the tidewater. To the west of the tidewater we start to run into the area of Iroquois expansion during the Beaver Wars so I will dive further south.  Between 1657 and 1717,  traders operating out of Virginia and Carolina colonies united the greater U.S. Southeast based on the trade of Indian slaves and deerskins. Though actual \"white guy presence\" was limited, the repercussions of the Indian slave trade destabilized the south. Pressure from the French and English spurred the rise of confederacies like the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw to deal with the encroachment of the French to the west (operating from Louisiana and the Mississippi River) and the English (with their native, slave-raiding allies) to the east. As an aside, from 1696-1700 a devastating smallpox epidemic spread through the southeast causing tremendous mortality in the region. Epidemics, combined with refugees fleeing the Yamasee War from 1715-1717, shattered the existing lifeways in the south. The interior southeastern nations, as well as the petite nations along the Gulf Coast, all felt the repercussions of contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717.  So, we are at the Mississippi and we have yet to encounter a Native American nation without contact with/significant influence from Europeans between 1657 and 1717. Obviously, the nations of New Mexico and Texas near Spanish missions are out of consideration. In New Mexico the Spanish presence along the Rio Grande ensures the Pueblos, Apaches, Utes, Dine, Comanche and many smaller Southwestern nations could contact a white guy. The first mission in Spanish Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas, was established in 1690. The Spanish presence in Texas was not influential, long-lived, or particularly productive during our time period, but it does mean we need to look north of the Red River for a nation that fits our criteria (Edit: The first mission founded in the geographic region that we know as Texas was San Angelo, founded in 1632. Thanks to /u/_choupette for clarifying.)  Where does this leave us? In 1717 you would need to be on the Great Plains, likely north of the Red River, and west of French influence along the Mississippi River/Great Lakes to encounter a Native American nation that had yet to contact a white person. Even then, contact was imminent. For example, the first European encounter with the Mandan occurred with the arrival of a French Canadian trader, Sieur de la Verendrye, in 1738.  **Sources**  Calloway *Once Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis and Clark*  Kelton *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast 1492-1715*  Gallay *The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*  Bragdon *Native Peoples of Southern New England, 1650-1775*  Trigger *The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660*  Weber *The Spanish Frontier in North America*"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: After playing a ton of Red Dead Redemption, I began to wonder; how often did \"outlaws\" in the \"Wild West\" commit murder without being caught or, more specifically, without being identified?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " So there are two answers to this, of a sort. The first is that the idea of violence in the American West is very different in reality than it is as portrayed in popular media. I've written elsewhere about the most popular visual representation of this, the 'duel at high noon', which is almost entirely absent from the historical record despite being the climactic showdown of countless dime novels and films, but looking more broadly too, while that isn't to say the West *wasn't* violent, it certainly wasn't lawless. Historiography since the 1970s or so has mostly pushed back against the idea of the \"Wild, Wild West\", even if the public mind hasn't, and continues to relish the image.   In any case though, body counts get exaggerated in the retelling, and that is assuming the best of intentions. Much of Dodge City's infamous reputation was created from whole cloth by Stuart Lake who did a supposedly \"as-told-to\" autiobiography of Wyatt Earp which quotes liberally from primary sources that never existed to describe dozens of deaths that never happened, while in reality its \"wild days\" were limited to the first year or so of settlement. Similarly Montana Territory was claimed to have over 100 murders by the editor Thomas Dimsdale, but the reality is often much duller. Scholarly assessment of the period substantiates eight in that time frame. Similarly, take a place such as Deadwood, a well known locale for its lack of any actual law enforcement during its initial settlement and most famously represented in the show of the same name... which only experienced 4 murders in that first year of settlement-without-law enforcement - possibly less than a single episode of the show, although it has been ages since I watched it. Returning to Dodge city though, when one year the city experienced a total of 5 murders, this was heralded as a \"civic disaster\", the highest total the city experienced aside from its first year of habitation in 1872 when the entirety of its wild reputation was earned, with slightly over a dozen homicides of all types (murder, self-defense, manslaughter).  Now to be sure, looking at raw numbers tells only half the tale, and it is homicide rates can tell us another side. 5 deaths in a population of 600 is a much bigger deal than a population of 6 million, after all, but as they say, it is pretty easy to lie with statistics. If I told you that the homicide rate in Dodge City was 100.4 per 100,000 (the US was 5.3 per 100,000 in 2016 for comparison) in 1880, that would seem shocking... but if I told you a single person was murdered that year, it would seem considerably less so! The population that year was only 996, and the death of Henry Heck at the hands of John Gill was the sole difference between a murder rate of 0 and 100. This is quite important in understanding how murder was viewed in the period, as the difference in *rates* seems high, but was likely quite unconcerning to the population when it was a difference of only one, two, or maybe three people.  Now to be sure, this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I preface all of this to say that when we are talking about murder in the American West, we're talking about very small numbers. A sheriff in many towns might never even have to draw his gun in his career, and even in a \"violent\" place like Dodge City, the coroner was being called out a few times per year. Lawmen would be much more likely to be hunting down horse thieves and cattle rustlers, which happened at a great deal high rate. Dykstra's \"Quantifying the Wild West\" and \"To Live and Die in Dodge City\" are both useful for a good deal more statistical analysis stuff, which is interesting, but not what we need to dive into here.  Now, let us say that someone has been murdered. The location isn't terribly important, but let's follow the case of Lincoln County, Nebraska as that is what I have sources on, although this is really quite equally applicable to most settled areas, lawmen and legal systems being present and generally followed in any town or city of any noticeable size.   Anyways, for starters, often the sheriff or his deputies needed to do next to nothing when someone was killed, not because of the evidence, but because they would turn themselves in. Claims of justification or self-defense were fairly common, the law about it permissive, and assuming prosecutors even thought to go through with it, juries were not unsympathetic. In the strange perspective of the West, murder wasn't even seen as the worst crime - horse thieves often enjoyed worse sentences - and *how* one dealt with the killing, presenting their actions as honorable and correct, could go a long way. Will Hale, for instance, murdered several people in 1870s Texas, the first a man who hat been cheating at cards, and then following that his brothers when they attempted to exact their revenge. The first killing was likely unjustified by the law, but prosecutors didn't feel it worth going after, and the latter ones were considered self-defense so given a pass as well.  Especially if there were no witnesses, a homicide committed in private could be presented as the killer was able to justify it, but even with several, if the victim 'had it coming' prosecutorial discretion would often let it slide and leave many murders unindicted. Only a total of four murders in Lincoln County during the 1870-1900 period actually proved to require real investigation by law enforcement, lacking witnesses to name a suspect, and these perhaps speak to the core of your question here.  The most interesting case is that of the murder of Kate Manning, killed at her land claim in 1871, a very clear execution by single gunshot. A sheriff and deputy were called and found footprints which they took plaster molds of. Comparison with suspects showed that her own brother, Peter, matched due to a deformity of the foot and he was brought to trial. What is important here is that he was found not guilty. Maintaining his innocence, we can easily presume that the jury didn't find a brother visiting his sister to be compelling enough evidence to go beyond 'reasonable doubt', although my efforts to find the trial documents for State v. Manning failed so we can't say for certain (Records are here just presumably not digitized). In 1871, Loyal Bly was found murdered but a lack of an clues at the scene meant there was nothing to go on. A more successful case, regarding the death of a cowboy, was solved when the murderer turned out to be a fellow cowboy he had worked with and not gotten along with.  To in short there, how would you get away with murder in the \"Wild West\"? Don't have any witnesses, and don't be the person with the most motive. Circumstantial evidence could, at least in the case of Manning, be explained away, and if there was nothing at the scene of the crime at all, it would likely be a dead end for investigation, especially lacking modern forensics. Lacking clues the only real avenue was checking to see \"Who might have wanted them dead?\" and if you weren't that person, you probably could get away with it scott free.   A side note of course can be made here, namely that the courts themselves and the court of public opinion were different beasts. Attempts to lynch suspects before trials were not unheard of, especially if the victim was popular, young, or female. Manning was nearly subjected to one for instance, and it was common to move the venue of a trial, both for the safety of the accused lest a mob conspire to take him, and also to ensure a more impartial jury. So in any case, the point here is that even if you might be \"Not Guilty\" by standards of the court, being caught at all could have its dangers no matter your confidence in acquittal. But the larger picture, really, should be that murders weren't that common, and real \"Who Dunnits\" were quite few and far between.  **Sources**  Dykstra, Robert R. \"Quantifying the Wild West: The Problematic Statistics of Frontier Violence\" *Western Historical Quarterly* 40 (Autumn 2009): 321-347  -- \"To Live and Die in Dodge City: Body Counts, Law and Order, and the Case of Kansas v.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why did pizza have the entire delivery market locked down for so long before everyone else jumped on?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " there are two major facts that led to pizza becoming THE dish to be ordered via telephone and delivered to the home.     After World War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.      While, at the same time  an estimated 600,000 of Italians arrived in America in the decades following the war. As was, and still is a regular occurrence for immigrants, a large number of them ended up working in the food industry, often opening inexpensive restaurants serving Italian food.     Which was a fortuitous choice, because not long before, the American veterans of campaigns in Italy returned home, with a taste for Italian food already developed.     As it were, first inexpensive and proliferated telephones, and the influx of cheap, tasty Italian food was a match made in heaven. The startup family restaurants ran by Italian immigrants could not compete with established food industry, could not afford rent on big floors required for a major restaurant to sit enough clients to support themselves, But they could deliver the food to the homes of their patrons; both to other Italian-Americans, as well as a growing number of other ethnicities as well.      This, in turn, worked well with an increased demand for ready-made food, required due to an increasing percentage of women joining the workforce and thus unable to cook at home.     Now, this part was easy to answer, but why PIZZA of all the possible Italian dishes?     There is no definite answer, as usual for matters of taste and preference. I would approach it from a perspective on not a historian, but an archaeologist of technology.     Pizza, at its most basic, is simply a flat-bread with cheap toppings. Flat bread is by far the most popular dish in the world, eaten in various forms by virtually every culture known to historians, but especially popular among Mediterranean cultures. It is very cheap, calories-dense, does not spoil easily, easy to transport, share and cut, and can be eaten with anything.   We know it as pita, naan, flatcakes, or chatapouri, but its pizza that manages to be both cheap, and \"luxurious\" looking enough to be sellable to strangers who might be not familiar with it. It requires no rare ingredients, the procedure of making it is easy, and about the only non standard piece of equipment needed is a wide oven. It is also easily stackable and transportable, which was a non trivial matter to delivery men in 1950s automobiles and bike delivery.

What is the relationship between these cultures and gender bending practices like crossdressing in the early and premodern period?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Since I'm on break I'll give a go at answering when and how this stereotype started, specifically how Thai cinema has contributed to acceptance of trans individuals in Thailand. However, I'd like to note that I'm not Thai, and I'm sure others have a better understanding of this topic than I do.    In Thailand, the most commonly used word to refer for a male-to-female trans person is a kathoey. For the purposes of this post, I'll refer to Thai MTF trans individuals as kathoeys, though in reality this is a broader term that can also refer to effeminate gay men, and also despite the fact that most Thai transwomen refer to themselves simply as \"phuying\" (women).   As in the US (and much of the world) transgenderism has not always been an altogether mainstream topic in Thailand. Still the country is 95% Buddhist, a religion which has no specific laws surrounding transgenderism, and as a result, sex reassignment surgeries had begun being performed in Thailand starting in 1975. However, in the first half of the 20th century, there was still a degree of stigma surrounding kathoeys for a variety of reasons. The first movies surrounding kathoeys were released in the 1980's, and reflected this in their depiction of kathoeys as depressed, tragic characters. Perhaps the first mainstream movie that portrayed kathoeys was *The Last Song,* a 1985 movie about a kathoey cabaret performer who falls in love with a man who eventually leaves her for a biological woman, leading to her suicide. Though in *The Last Song* the kathoey identity is portrayed negatively, the movie began a trend of mainstream sympathy for kathoeys. More 1980's movies centered around kathoeys followed *The Last Song*, generally presenting kathoeys as tragic characters suffering from bad karma.   In 1996, a northern Thai volleyball team made up of mainly kathoeys won the Thai national volleyball tournament. Though they were banned from representing Thailand internationally, the 2000 movie *Iron Ladies* dramatizing their journey became the highest grossing domestic Thai movie until that point. This film likely marked a turning point in Thai cinema as kathoeys began stop being viewed solely as sympathetic, tragic characters.  This is all relevant because representation of kathoeys in Thai media has helped to socially destigmatize transgenderism in Thailand relative to other Asian countries. Thailand's relaxed stance on both prostitution and SRS has made the country a destination for both trans individuals and sex tourists from the US.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why are the former states of the Confederacy now some of the most fervently patriotic in the US, and when did that change? Anyone who's driven around the American South has seen the \"Confederate flag\" somewhere, often hanging or flying near an American flag. Much of Southern culture and identity seems to be focused around patriotism, even while people espouse \"Lost Cause\" ideology. How did this region go from insurrection to fervent patriotism, and how have those two ideas been reconciled so completely in many peoples' minds?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " This is not an answer to your question as such but you may wish to examine closely the language you're using and determine if you mean \"nationalism\" or \"patriotism\" and what, if any, distinction exists between the two. I raise this question because the focus on the primacy of the state vs that of national culture and identity changes the nature of the conflict you're addressing.   I'd also argue that this may not be the most suitable sub for this question as notions of patriotism and national identity are socially constructed and our modern viewpoint presupposes a modern definition of both, which necessarily falls within the 20 year blackout zone.   That said, you're probably asking two questions - how the Lost Cause is compatible with American Patriotism and how southern culture came to be seen as more authentically American (regionally or nationally) than, say, Eastern or Western or Southwestern culture."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why do Communist societies that we've seen tend toward authoritarianism and dictatorial-style arrangements? First off, I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge on this topic, and want to note that I almost asked this in /r/NoStupidQuestions but decided an educated answer would be better than a flamewar. And before anyone says it, sure, maybe prehistoric tribes can be labelled \"communist\" and maybe didn't operate this way, but I am referring to the myriad 20th century communist countries that made up the \"second World\".   It's hard to get a clear answer without devolving into \"communism bad\" \"no, communism good\". From what I can tell, it's not necessarily required for a communist state to have a single authoritarian leader, yet all real-world examples I can think of had very consolidated power arrangements into a single position? There are free-market dictatorships and free-market republics, but it seems that any Communist state went down an authoritarian route of some kind-- Stalin, Tito, Mao, Castro? I'm familiar with the concept of the Vanguard of the Revolution, but surely this is not the only way to proceed forward?  Some hypotheses I've had on the matter include:   * Maybe I'm saturated in propaganda from an American public school system and actually the dictatorish nature of Communist societies I'd heard about is exaggerated/didn't hear about the examples where this didn't happen?   * Or, if it was accurate, it was a \"fruit of the poisoned tree\" situation, where since the Soviets went down a dictatorial Stalinist path and assisted the other communist countries in setting up, they imprinted this system onto them as well?   * There's also an issue of post-revolution political disarray generally giving rise to tyrants, which, when combined with Communism often being instated via revolution, yields a high risk of a tyrant seizing power.  Am I feeling around on the right path, or am I way off the mark?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There is no single accepted answer among academic historians or even among leftists. As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes *really* difficult to separate history proper from politics.   One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context.   A good starting point I think is the late 19th century, when the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe, suffered an internal crisis between *reformists* and *revolutionists*. At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and within the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway. Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of overcoming capitalism; the major disagreement was if this could be achieved by working entirely within the bourgeois state. This question of reform or revolution is discussed with some more historical context in the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg's eponymous pamphlet, written at the height of this conflict. Eduard Bernstein's works give the reformist perspective.  (As an aside, Rosa Luxemburg was a revolutionist in Germany and Poland who collaborated extensively with Lenin. She would later disagree tactically with Lenin during the Russian revolution but, as I believe, they had no fundamental doctrinal differences-- one can expect that Luxemburg's comments about reform and revolution are broadly the same as Lenin's)  As Europe approached the First World War, the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and even take on a nationalistic character. By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, having achieved significant labor reforms and boasting a membership in the millions. This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russia, compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism, and national defense with the defense of socialism (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France *against* Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat against their republic). Revolutionists, on the other hand, tended to have an internationalist outlook, believing that only an international revolution against imperialist warfare could defend socialism.  When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war, beginning a period of *Burgfriedenspolitik* wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. The revolutionists and few reformists who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the Independent SPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. Notably, Lenin's party in Russia also opposed war by majority, foreshadowing the dominance of revolutionists in the upcoming struggle.  This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionist factions of the European socialists. This conflict would take on its most bloody form in the 1918-19 Spartacus uprising at the end of the German revolution: once in power, the now wholly reformist SPD would brutally crush their revolutionist counterparts as they attempted to establish worker's states. Remember again that these were former comrades who, decades ago, would have relied on each other's cooperation.  So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? The leaders of the Russian revolution were internationalists, and had counted on the victory of the German revolutionaries and, hence, the victory of a sweeping revolution across the world. The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. This didn't happen-- again, the German revolutionaries were massacred by reformists. It's possible that the Bolsheviks miscalculated, or simply that the Bolsheviks had no other choice but to push forward and *hope* that Germany would turn around. Probably both. In any case, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, *very* difficult situation: they were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states (particularly now Germany) on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.  Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in The Russian Tragedy (which is short but extremely useful in understanding the attitudes of communists at the time -- a must read!):  > The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the *German*, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... **Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.**  As an example of \"wrong tactics,\" Trotsky discusses in a report that the early Soviet worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war. Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to survive at all.  As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death, and Stalin would further entrench authoritarianism-- what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away. (EDIT: This part feels a bit insufficient. I don't want to attribute the entrenchment of authoritarianism as something unique to Stalin as a person -- it was likely a combination of broad social forces and personality. I might point to the rising nationalism in Marxist reformists are an analogous process, but this would require a more detailed treatment of Stalin I am not really prepared to make.)  For subsequent revolutions, the \"fruit from a poisoned tree\" situation you described is sort of right-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases. Later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian.   It's probably not true that failure was inevitable, which would ignore the later history of Trotskyism and other oppositional forces in, most notably, the USSR and the China. But I don't want to spin off into counterfactuals-- things *could* have happened differently, but they didn't, and that's the question you're asking.  In summary:  * Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism  * This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country  * Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat  * Later, the static international situation allowed authoritarianism to be entrenched  * Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation  Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.  Further reading:  * Luxemburg's The Russian Tragedy, which discusses the Bolsheviks' policies in relation to the German socialists  * Luxemburg's The Crisis of German Social Democracy which goes in depth about the division and irreconciliability of factions within the SPD  * The Military Writings of Trotsky, for a deeper look into the Russian Civil War  * Lenin's The State and Revolution, key to understanding the place of democracy in Lenin's ideology"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: There are huge gaps between islands in the Pacific, what methods did the Polynesians/Islanders use to discover them and to stay on course in a trip between two islands they already knew existed? Do we know how many/what percentage were lost at sea?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The Pacific Islands are wonderfully diverse and yet there is also a growing and unified cultural concept of what it means to be a Pacific Islander in the modern world and contexts, this identity being formed not only by modern political experiences and attitudes, but also by genetic links- between Micronesians and Polynesians- and certain shared histories, largely in the context of colonisation and independence, with the area the islands are spread across being so large as to leave it difficult to find simply a shared identity on the basis of geography, when some live in the highlands of Papua, and others on small atolls.   Traditionally, the Pacific Islands have been divided into Micronesia (small), Polynesia (many) and Melanesia (black), however these boundaries are not so easily drawn, not just as a result of geography, but as a result of culture, ethnic and genetic heritage and even language. Even within the classical divisions of the Pacific Islands, there is conflict over identity, such as with the Bougainville independence movement. Many Islanders and academics now prefer to use geographical divisions, North, East, South, West, and being more specific by naming individual places, whether countries, atolls or islands, instead of identifying places by concepts which were driven and created by Western colonists, as a result of the growing movement within the Pacific Islander communities, to drive academic understandings and literature, although today, the vast majority of historians and archaeologists of the Pacific Islands are still not of indigenous Islander heritage.   Although, as with every place, there is a long history of, well, learning and constructing history, across Islander societies and cultures, only recently have Islanders' constructions and narratives entered, or been allowed to enter, academia, and only recently have Islanders significantly been able to contribute to the academic understandings of Pacific history, to be the writers of their own history for non-Islanders, whereas even in the 20th century, they were often restricted to being the subjects, but not the authors, and in any writing of history, they were often equally restricted to being the one acted on, instead of being active in history themselves. Outside of academia, historically Islanders have seen the history of their ancestors or heritage, as part of a greater understanding of the world, with legend and history being deeply intertwined pre-European contact, in a similar way to the Romulus and Remus origins of Rome, Torres Strait Islanders- sometimes seen as Pacific Islanders- had the story of a woman making a tunnel from the sky in order to save her children from being killed. Oral traditions such as this are still central and important to many Islanders' politics and to many Pacific structures and communities, as well as to the faith of many Islanders, and their expressions of their identity, be it as someone from Hawai'i, from Polynesia, or from the Pacific Islands, as an example.   Post-European contact, many Islanders' understanding of history changed, with histories being written down, or being expressed in the traditional forms of Western settlers and coloniser, or to include settler ideals and ideas of history. This means that there is no one genre of Pacific history, there is no one lens it has traditionally been looked at through. Across the islands, genealogy has been a important and central part of society, identity and culture, and this continues today, for example. How Islanders have viewed and understood history changed and developed pre-European contact, during colonisation and into the modern era, with no one singular idea of history or methods of interpretation or recording, although genealogy remains a central and important part of identity for many Islanders, as it was pre-European contact.   It was only in the 1960s that Islanders' agency and viewpoints became a central part of Pacific history, and early reports by Europeans of technology which could reasonably be expected to have existed pre-European contact is therefore clouded by assumptions and by the contexts of the understanding of Islanders, of seafaring and also of record keeping, anthropology, society and history that they carried with them, and indigenous writers of Pacific history in Western academic tradition have only become common in the last few decades, notably from what is classically identified as Polynesia.   With the large number of inhabited islands, and an even larger number of islands when including those, such as Caroline Island in Kiribati, which had previously been inhabited, it is to be expected that there will be vastly different relations to the ocean, allowing movement between the atolls and islands, which have been of central importance to Pacific Islanders throughout history, excluding parts of what is now New Zealand, West Papua and Papua New Guinea. With some islanders living in closely linked island chains, such as in the Marshall Islands, and others living thousands of miles from the nearest small settlement, the technology and techniques allowing for exploration, colonisation and general transport have vastly differed, and changed throughout history, including pre-European contact.   Evidence for the earliest seafaring technology in the Pacific Islands is sparse, and even for later history, oral tradition is an important part of understanding Pacific Islanders' oceanic history and heritage. The extent of archaeological evidence that remains from the earliest centuries or even millennia of settlement in multiple islands, is small, with, for example, no Lapita boats existing, and the only Lapita material culture found having little or no relation to the ocean, instead, any oceanic exploration and travel by the Lapita must be worked out far more indirectly, through genetic heritage of existing populations, material culture unrelated to transport, such as pottery, and even language.   We know parts of New Guinea were settled some 30-40,000 years ago, through radiocarbon dating of a rock shelter, and although outside of the Pacific Islands, in Australia, there is evidence of settlement across Australia, down to Tasmania, from a similar period, or some very uncertain evidence of settlement dating back over 50,000 years, when it was, at the time, still connected to what is now Papua New Guinea. We don't know, however, if a rising ocean swallowed earlier evidence elsewhere, whether there are island settlements submerged showing earlier settlement, or at least exploration. The ever changing shape of the Pacific Ocean has created the ever changing shapes of the Pacific Islands, with evidence obscured and uncovered with changing ocean currents and sea levels, any older settlements may never be found, and therefore it is possible that humanity came to the Pacific Islands past 40,000 years ago. The dates are important because land bridges have since disappeared as connections between islands and settlements, and therefore our concepts of the process of settlement will also be affected. Settlers undoubtedly came from South East Asia, where similar dates of settlement, 30-40,000 years ago, are shown, including areas of Indonesia, although early *homo* settlement in SE Asia, dating perhaps a million years or older, is found in Java, relatively close to parts of what is classically defined as Melanesia.   To reach New Guinea, water would indeed have to have been crossed, even if there were some disappearing land bridges which allowed travel from what continues to be mainland SE Asia to much of Malaysia and even much of Indonesia. Settlement would have reached the Solomon Islands just under 30,000 years ago, and again, ocean had to have been travelled.  The craft used, and any losses when attempting to find inhabitable land, are unknown. The later settlers of the Pacific Islands saw multiple different paths of heritage and development for their seafaring technology, oral traditions not appearing to relate to these settlers or at least not their crafts, and even those who are not Pacific Islanders, who trace descent back to these Pleistocene settlers and who saw little or no impact from further waves of settlement, for example, by the Lapita, namely Australian Aborigines, have craft which are either frankly unable to make any sea crossings or do not appear to have developed from thousands of years old technology, or have developed so far away as to be of little use to tracing these Pleistocene vessels, as a result of thousands of years of change, refinement and transforming needs, cultures and societies."
