    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: Why do datacenters continuously use more water instead of recycling the same water in a closed loop system?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " AH! a question in an area of my expertise. There are at least three variants of water-consuming datacenter cooling.  1. The datacenter captures the hot air coming out of servers. Radiators with cool water circulating through them are used to cool this hot air. The water is heated while the air is cooled. That water is then pumped outside and poured over big fiber boards while a fan blows outside air past them. This evaporates some of the water, and the remainder is cooled by the evaporation. The remaining cooled water is pumped back inside the datacenter and the process repeats. 2. The datacenter uses industrial air conditioning units called CRACs, which have radiators outside the datacenter. The air conditioner compresses a gas, heating it up, and then pumps it through the radiator while a fan blows outside air across the radiators. Once the compressed gas is cooled, it is brought back into the datacenter and allowed to expand, which makes it cold. Air inside the datacenter is blown over a different radiator filled with this cold gas, cooling the datacenter air. On very hot days, the CRAC sprays the outside radiators with water, which evaporates on the radiator and cools it more than the air alone would. 3. The datacenter brings in outside air directly to keep the inside air cool. On hot days, the datacenter's systems will spray a mist of water into the air on its way in. That mist evaporates quickly and cools the outside air further before it reaches the datacenter floor."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: why aren't cars something that sell for a standard price from the manufacturer? Also, how come a sticker price for a car on a lot that's just designed to \"get people in the door\" isn't considered false/misleading advertising? (Since the actual price usually ends up being a couple grand more)\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Cars use the dealership system because car dealerships lobbied the government to make it that way. This made sense back when cars were fairly new to the mass market. Regular garages and auto shops were more capable of dealing with service needs (since they were plentiful) than the manufacturer itself (which was only concerned with cranking out more cars, not fixing existing ones). Furthermore it was actually more stable for car makers at the time. A dealer would order in bulk and those sales were guaranteed for the maker. The issue of actually selling to a consumer was no longer the auto makers problem. Since the only way for common folk to spread information back then and until recently was just word of mouth haggling was the standard and so was mark up. It was really hard to find out information. There is less need now since most manufacturers do not void warranty if service is done outside of a dealership and haggling is a pain in the ass, but the buyers have the internet at their disposal to give them the upper hand. Tesla already sells directly to the consumer. You can enter a Tesla showroom, test drive, build and price your car, place the order and some time later your Tesla shows up at your door. Some independent dealers have experimented with this model as well with good results. Since dealerships are responsible for selling they get to set the price, the difference between what they paid for the car and what you pay is profit for the dealership.  As for price. Cars can be highly customized and even the cheapest car can cost a lot with every single option picked out. The reason the base price is usually much cheaper than the average build is that the most desirable features come with a huge price. I could, for example buy a Chevrolet spark for 10,000 dollars or so and pay only that. But that doesn't even get me air conditioning. To get AC I need to spend an extra 3000 on the next trim level (AC doesn't come as a standalone option). This is a common thing among automakers because AC is THAT desirable. Also those who can't or don't want to drive manual need to spend an extra 2000 on the automatic transmission. Add a few more bits and things and the final price rises. Also you need to pay a destination fee (cost to ship your car to the dealer) and by federal law this is required to be the same for all dealerships throughout the country, no matter the distance from the plant. Then if you got the AC you have a mandatory AC fee which is used to cover the costs of scrapping the AC when the car is eventually junked. After All of that you pay the standard sales tax which varies based on where you live. If you aren't paying cash you are likely going to get hit with fees for financing.   It is possible though to walk into a dealership, buy the cheapest possible car at the advertised price, paying only destination and tax with cash upfront, and walkaway not \"cheated\". Maybe haggling isn't so bad after all.  PS: the MSRP on a car isn't it's exact price of what the dealer pays the maker. It is the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price, AKA what the maker recommends selling it for if the dealer wants to be competitive while still turning a profit."

I would wake up at night with a flashlight looking after I felt them crawling on me.  I’m not saying ants were the only method I used to fend them off, but they definitely were the straw that broke the bedbugs back.  I was broke and could not afford everything at once, so I started with the ants on week one.

Something is \"bad for the planet\" when it harms systems we, humans, want to preserve.

I've had a colonoscopy (without pain relief) where they took biopsies. The doctors said the biopsies wouldn't hurt because the colon couldn't feel pain, and they were indeed painless. The amount of air they pumped in was horrifically painful however.   Trapped gas sounds trivial, but can also be extremely painful. Ulcerative colitis also hurts. So does diarrhoea.   So how do these pain mechanisms work? What causes the pain, if the interior of the colon is unfeeling?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " A simple way to think of the colon and pain is to relate it to the skin. Lots of different things can cause different types of pain in the skin. There's pressure, heat, cold, cuts and probably a few more. There is a specific type of nerve ending to sense each type of pain.  The colon (the entire intestine, in fact) has only two types of pain receptors - ones that sense stretching, and ones that sense lack of oxygen (which happens when the colon is starved of blood). Trapped gas will make the colon wider, which sets off the stretching pain receptors. Biopsies don't hurt because the colon lacks the nerve endings to sense cuts and bruises."

You are correct that it doesn't make any sense because at face value, this breaks the second law of thermodynamics. The current hypotheses basically revolve around some method of transporting heat from the suns interior through something akin to a soundwave but we have struggled to identify waves propagating through the corona. The competing hypothesis involves some weird interactions with magnetic fields breaking and reconnecting. This process generates electrical currents and waves supplying heat to the corona. This is how solar flares form (we think) and it's thought that there are lots and lots of tiny solar flares occurring at all times which can provide heat to the corona."

    "golden_answer": " Ceramic is very hard. Not in the general, colloquial sense of hard, but in the Mohs Hardness Scale. That scale measures whether or not something can scratch something else. Diamond is the hardest on this scale - not because you can't break diamond. Diamonds are pretty brittle, you can easily crack or shatter them with a hammer. But you can't *scratch* them.  Tempered glass is made by putting the glass in tension. You cool the glass so that the outside shrinks, compressing the still-hot inside. When the inside then cools, the outside is frozen in place so the inside pulls tightly on it the inside contracts. The glass pulling on itself keeps the molecules from moving, and holds it all together strongly so it's very hard to break.  By scratching the surface, ceramic breaks the tension, releasing *all* of it throughout the glass."

    "golden_answer": " English did not originally have fixed spelling.  People would spell words however they thought it sounded.  This means that spelling varied from person to person and region to region.  Also, due to being made of bits of several languages all smushed together often retaining parts of the original language's rules, there's no consistency as to how words are pronounced or where you even get the spelling from.  A man named Samuel Johnson  eventually wrote a dictionary in which he spelled the words however he wanted to and because of how popular it became, that became the fixed spelling. Johson liked stuffy fancy spellings rather than simple phonetic ones and he set the idea of telling people the \"correct\" way to write instead of telling them how words were normally used. Webster eventually did something similar for American English, although he preferred simplified spellings, hence some of the differences between American and British spelling."

    "golden_answer": " It seems like everybody is not actually reading the question you are asking, and is just giving you a generic answer about why/when we use \"a\" and \"and\" in English. It seems like you are asking: English avoids mashing vowel sounds together by adding \"-n\" to \"a\", but why doesn't it do something similar to other words that end in vowels? Like, the phrase \"a apple\" sounds bad so there is a rule to avoid it, but there is no rule about the phrase \"extra apple\" even though it has the same sounds in the same order. Why don't we say \"extran apple\" instead?  It's probably because \"a\" is such a short word, that it gets lost when placed next to another vowel sound. But a longer word that ends with the same sound, like \"extra\" is long and distinct enough that you still clearly hear it even when placed next to another vowel sound. If you mash the words together, like \"extrapple\", you can still pick out \"extra\" and \"apple\". If you mash \"a\" and \"apple\" together, you just get \"apple\": the \"a\" gets swallowed up, so a special rule is needed to keep it distinct."

    "golden_answer": " I know others are talking about heat capacity and stuff, but in my dishwasher everything that's flat gets dry; everything that's curved somehow does not. For example, I put my ceramic coffee mugs into the rack upside down, and the bottoms, which are slightly concave, are still wet when I pull them out. My ceramic plates I put it on edge and are dry. My tubberware, like my coffee mugs, aren't edge down, and the water catches in the nooks and crannies in the same way.  The shape of an edge-down dish or flat surface allows the water to spread out, which gives it more surface area to evaporate or plain drip off. When there's a curve to catch water, like the lip under a tubberware edge, the water can \"pile up\" on top of itself, so it takes many times longer to evaporate. At least in my dishwasher, those are the areas where water accumulates for me, regardless of the dish's material.  Edit: If we're going to talk heat capacities, water has the highest heat capacity of any of these materials by a considerable margin, so merely the surface-to-surface contact of water with a dish, whether plastic or glass or ceramic, isn't going to mean as much if the water is stacked up in a groove insulating itself. The surface area:volume should be the greatest factor, imo. The small difference in time the water's contact layer is exposed to a glass's higher temperature before plastic reaches about the same temperature will play a minimal role in comparison. But that's just my speculation. It'd be interesting to put a plastic plate into a dishwasher, with the same shape as a ceramic/glass plate, and see. My speculation is all 3 would be dry."

The gene that makes the frog poisonous exists in many frogs, not just this one individual frog.

    "golden_answer": " The moon and Pluto do not have active tectonics that shapes the surface. It also has no atmosphere with wind and water that can erode craters.  The brighter part of the lunar surface is called the highlands, the was formed 4.1-4.4 billion years ago.   The darker areas, Lunar mare (mare is latin for sea) is formed for a volcanic eruption. They are younger with an avrage of 3-3-5 billion year old, the youngest are around 1.2 billion years old. There are fewer crates in the mares and it is by counting crates that ages of the youngest part are counted.  So the surface of the moon has been unchanged for billion of years with the exception of impacts. Nothing will destroy them except other impaces.  So we can see lots of impact on the moon because we can see all that have been formed for billions of years.  Earths surface is continuously changing.  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater that a result of the impact that is a major part of the extension of non-avian dinosaurs is practically invisible today. If was formed 66 million years ago and had a diameter of 150km. Evidence that there was a impace ther was discovered in the 1970 but only confirmed in the 1990s by looking at impact damage on rocks.  If you compare to craters on the moon there are 70 larger than this. So a what would be a large crater on the moon can't be visually detected on earth after 66 million years. The youngest part of the moon surface is 18x as old and the oldest pars 63x as old. The number of impacts has decreased over time in the solar system.   Something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater that is clearly a crate is only 50 000 years old and is in a desert.  If you look at  Lake Bosumtwi https://goo.gl/maps/35Ykq11Zx1sumKeT8 you see a lake with some mountains around it. That is a 1 million years 10km diameter impact crater in an area with lots of rains and plants. If you look carefully at it is not hard to understand that is an old impact crater or a volcanic caldera, but do not look like a typical crater on the moon.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bosumtwi    So crates remain for billions of years on the moon but disappear quickly on earth."

I get the idea that power is generated by large power plants that send through various transformers until it gets to my house. What I don’t understand is how the power grid knows electricity is being used. When my solar panels send electricity back to the grid, where does it go? Do the power plants constantly adjust production based on momentary demand or is there a such thing as power storage for the grid?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " A power grid is often referred to as an \"infinite bus.\" You have numerous generation sources and numerous loads using the energy. The contribution of any particular generator has little effect on the grid as a whole. However, the grid cannot store energy. (There are large-scale battery storage projects coming on line, but those still function as either a generation source or as a load when the batteries are charging.) The total amount of energy input to the grid must equal the energy being used. Therefore, you have several classes of generation, including base load (usually big coal or nuclear plants), load followers (large or small plants that are ramped up or down to match the demand), and peakers (usually smaller stations that can be put on line in a hurry to match peak demand.) Hydropower is especially useful in maintaining balance as it can be ramped up and down dramatically in a short time.  A system must have enough \"spinning reserve\" to match any short-term spikes in load. If the demand exceeds generation and no more generation can be ramped up or brought on line, the frequency on the grid is affected and the system can become unstable in some situations. Worst-case scenario is generation starts tripping off-line and parts of the grid become \"islanded.\" Sections can be shed off to preserve the health of the grid as a whole.  Most modern grids have a balancing authority, such as an Independent System Operator (ISO), which procures and schedules generation during the day in anticipation of the estimated load during different times of day."

People always freak out about eating raw cookie dough for fear of salmonella due to the raw eggs.  Yet raw egg whites have been a common ingredient in fancy cocktails for ages and its never been questioned or regarded as dangerous.  What gives?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Hello! I’m a food scientist, and to address your concern about the cookie dough specifically, cookie dough is labeled with warnings not necessarily because of the eggs (although there will always be concerns with raw poultry products and salmonella), but because of the flour.   Think of it this way. Flour is a processed grain that is essentially taken from the field and ground into flour by mechanical means. While there are other steps sometimes involved (whole wheat flour vs. regular flour, cake flour vs. regular flour all involve different processing steps), the flour is not taken through enough steps during processing that can guarantee pathogens of concern are killed. So, bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, etc. can be introduced in the field or during processing, meaning it can end up ground right in the final flour.   However, this does not mean you should be scared of flour now. Flour is not a product typically eaten raw (ie. You don’t eat flour with a spoon), and almost everything you make with it will go through a significant heat kill step (baking, cooking, etc.), AKA you are getting rid of the bacteria.   This leads to why manufacturers put the warning on cookie dough. People enjoy raw cookie dough, so they are at risk of eating raw flour.   Yes, salmonella may exist in the cookie dough. Will it hurt you? No, not likely unless you are a person with a weakened immune system susceptible to foodborne illness (meaning it essentially takes less bacteria to make you sick because your body is not as well equipped to protect itself), or the cookie dough was temperature abused (meaning the cookie dough was not properly refrigerated, leading the cookie dough reaching an internal temperature that allows the bacteria to multiply more quickly, and more bacteria=more of a chance at getting sick).

I’ve wondered this for so long but don’t know how to articulate it well and also feel like it’s potentially a very dumb question but thought this would be a good place to ask it.   Essentially- while I’m working out, are the muscles building themselves during that time or is it a situation where you’d be able to see the effects afterwards like in the coming days? I hope that makes sense.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " You're actually gaining a pound or so of muscle mass every day, unfortunately you're losing about the same amount as well.  So on a typical day you get +100 muscle, and also -100 muscle, meaning you're +- 0. Diet and exercise can change these values, so by regularly exercising you might get +103 and -100 every day, meaning you gain +3. This is a slow process, you do get +3 every day, but it might take a total of 200 before there's a visible difference.  The more muscle mass you have, the more you'll also lose, so after a while, while still exercising regularly you'll reach a point where you get +103 and -103 every day, and you'll have to make your workout harder somehow in order to grow further.  My numbers are of course completely made up, but the point is that it's a constant tug of war, 24/7."

That title was abolished in 1707 (along with the title of King/Queen of Scotland) when the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed.  The title of the British  monarch changed again in 1801 to the King/Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and once more in 1921 to King/Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is the title that Elizabeth II had when she died. Those last couple of changes were more simply following political realities, but the main point is that in 1707 the Kingdom of England ceased to exist, and so did its monarchy.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: Why do we (Anglophones) use the native language name for some countries (Costa Rica, not Rich Coast), but not for others (Germany, not Deutschland)?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The name a foriegn language has for another country or region is called an exonym (outside name.)  Language is always evolving and sometimes the exonym evolves with the language or is borrowed from another language.  English speakers call Deutschland \"Germany\" because the region near modern day Deutschland was called \"Germania\" in Latin, which means \"where the Germani live.\" And Germani basically means \"neighbor\" in Latin.  Roughly similar lineage of people stayed living there and the Latin name wasn't forced to change, so the Latin name stuck in English (and Italian). However, not all Latin influenced languages used the same name. The French call Deutschland \"Allemagne\" from the name Alemmani which were a group of tribes in the area.  Then, you have exonyms that a country or people wants to change. For example, modern Iran used to be called \"Persia\" in English from Greek Persís from Old Persian  name for Cyrus the Great's people. Officially the name was changed to Iran by request of one of Iran's old leaders. Iran is roughly a changed spelling of the old Iranian word ērān which describes a people who lived in the area. However, during WW2, the Allies changed the name on maps back to Persia to avoid confusing it with Iraq, then it changed back to Iran, then some Iranians wanted to bring back the name Persia to connect Iran back to the old glory of the \"Persian Empire\" (and distance from the current Iranian government). Now the name Iran and Persia are both acceptable. So, for political and historic reasons, the exonym for Iran changed multiple times, often because people wanted actively to change the name for various reasons.  So... Exonyms are complex. They are often transmitted across languages and history and thus morph with time like all language. But country names are also political so sometimes exonyms are officially changed by governments or people.  Istanbul was Constantinople Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople Been a long time gone, Constantinople Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night.  Even old New York was once New Amsterdam. Why they changed it I can't say, I guess people just liked it better that way!"

    "golden_answer": " Why were taxes so high?  World War II.   All the military equipment, all the soldiers' pay, all the medical expenses, all the expenses had to be paid, somehow.    That somehow was with debt. Debt that had to be paid off by the government over the next 20-30 years.    So, during WWII, the British government (and ALL governments, actually), sold massive amounts of debt (war bonds) to everybody and anybody.    Years later, that debt had to be paid off. With interest.  To raise the amount of money needed to pay off that debt, the tax rates had to be ridiculously high, especially on high earners.    Remember, England was VERY hard hit by the war.  Rationing did not end until the mid 1950's.    Even the US had tax rates around 90% on top earners, in order to pay off the US war debt, pay for the rebuilding of Europe, and maintain the military at war footing for the first couple decades of the Cold War.    And, during that time, the US (and the UK) paid DOWN their massive deficits to more sustainable levels.    So, the whole debt crisis thing we keep talking about today, we KNOW how to reduce the debt.    We just don't wanna.    Were taxes that high sustainable?  Short term,yes. Long term, there wasn't a NEED to maintain the tax rates that high, once the hump of paying down the War Debt was gone."

    "golden_answer": " It's closer to the latter of the two, but it's both.  The key thing to understand is that when you see a stock quote or stock price, that is *the price at which shares changed hands most recently.* In other words, a few seconds ago someone sold a few shares to someone else at that price.  Importantly, a stock quote is *not an offer to buy or sell at that price.* So if you see a stock quote and you go sell your shares at \"market price\", you will get slightly higher or lower than the quote based on various factors. (The \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices in the quote are the current offers to buy and sell, respectively.)  A stock going down means that there are more sellers than buyers, \"the market\" is collectively pessimistic about the stock's value, and so the sellers are dropping their \"ask\" prices to get the few buyers to bite. Each successive trade is for a slightly lower price than the one before. This continues until the price hits a level where potential buyers start getting more excited and jumping in."

An electrical signal is created by this movement that copies the 'shape' of the sound the same way a camera captures the shape of what's in front of it.  In a condenser microphone the same effect is achieved with a super thin sheet of metal placed really close to another sheet of metal.

    "golden_answer": " That question is similar to, \"how is a forensic team investigating a crime able to know what happened if they never saw it?\" They find evidence that was left behind that they can peice together to form a complete picture of what happened.   Paleontologists do the same thing but with extinct animals. They use fossile records which can't be understated in usefulness. Some fossils are actually completely preserved in such a way that you can take it apart layer by layer and \"disect\" an ancient animal. You can see the remnants of the food they ate, the size and shape of internal organs, etc etc and in doing so use logical reasoning to figure out how those adaptations would have been used.  Enviormental evidence helps too. A creature that builds a whole lot of nest in the same general area is most likely to be a group/pack/herd animal, for example. You also have the standard rules of evolution to help give you ideas as well. An animal that sticks out like a sore thumb or has an extreme adaptation is a clue that they specialize in some skill or trait because specializations are an evolutionary risk. (You *better* excel at it if you specialize or you've got nothing to fall back on.)  Now, are they wrong sometimes? Definitely. Sometimes a hypothesis can look probable until someone finds evidence that conflicts with the idea. We saw dinosaurs as more reptilian for a long time, until people started find fossils that included examples of those dinos having feathers and other features that put them more inline with modern birds. Its a game of trial and error. The more evidence you can find, the more clear the picture can become."

    "golden_answer": " As cheese ages, enzymes and bacteria break down the protein and fat, creating a \"shorter\" texture (i.e. more brittle/crumbly) and the smaller molecules have stronger flavors than when they are intact. Sharp cheddar costs more because it has to be aged longer so you can't make money off of it for a longer period of time and it also costs money to warehouse it. Also it needs to be of a good enough quality to be ageable; cheese graders pull sample plugs at around a week after it is made and taste it to detect certain good and bad flavors that they think will allow it to be aged and not develop bitter, acidic or off flavors, otherwise it has to get used as a mild cheese. For aged cheese, they will continue to pull samples and taste it to see how the flavor is developing and determine how long to continue to age it.  Source: I'm a cheese scientist"

    "golden_answer": " In a word, electromagnetism.    You're probably familiar with electromagnetism, it's creating a magnetic field by running current (in other words, moving electric charge) through a conductor. You can make a simple electromagnet at home to show that this works.  The opposite also happens, when you move a magnetic field across a conductor it will induce current. This is how we generate most electricity: steam from burning coal, water from a dam, or wind is used to rotate magnets past coiled wires.  So, now, what happens when you  try and move a magnet across a piece of aluminum, which is conductive. As the magnet – and its magnetic field – move, it creates electricity (specifically called eddy currents) inside the aluminum. These currents, in turn, create a magnetic field, and this magnetic field opposes the motion of the magnet.   This can be used then, to separate metal from non-metals. By rapidly moving magnets (or using a quickly changing electromagnet), conductive materials are induced to move, and a setup is made where metal objects will be thrown forward, and non-metals fall from gravity. This, then, is the eddy current separator."

    "golden_answer": " This is indeed what they used to do. In late 19th, early 20th century warship photos you can see collapsed poles along the side of the ship, and on top is bundled netting. When deployed, it looked like this.  The problem is, you can't use torpedo nets while you're underway, and typically, your ships don't get attacked by torpedos when you're in harbor - shallow enclosed waters are not fun to be a submariner in if you get discovered - you get attacked by torpedoes when you're at sea and underway.   So torpedo nets were done away with largely by WWII and replaced with anti-torpedo bulges - these were a sacrificial fake outer hull, itself compartmentalized to minimize damage and water intake, that would force the torpedo to detonate outside of the main hull of the ship.   We've done away with even that because torpedos now are way more effective. Instead of trying to blast a hole in the side of the ship - which because of compartmentalization and damage control can be easily mitigated and would rarely immobilize a ship - they now are designed to detonate underneath the keel or bottom spine of the ship, breaking it in two essentially, buckling the hull and making so many tears and burst seams that saving the ship is impossible.  edit: keel not keep. damn autocorrect."

  {
    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: The Trans-Pacific Partnership deal Please post all your questions and explanations in this thread.   Thanks!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Alright, let's kick this one off.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a multi-layered deal whose particulars have just been agreed upon by the twelve participating countries. Its stated purpose is to reduce **tariffs** - taxes on bringing your goods into a country or sending them out - and therefore encourage industry by making it cheaper for importers and exporters to conduct business between these countries. Its other stated goal is to create a set of easy **rules** that businesses can live by when dealing between these countries.  The TPP is far more complex than that, however. Its subtextual function is to serve as a foundation from which to spread that set of easy rules to other Asian nations, with an eye to preventing China from setting standards among these countries first. The Obama administration is concerned that it's either \"us or them\" and that a Chinese-led trade agreement would set rules that American businesses would find problematic.  So what does it mean for you? Let's assume you are a citizen of one of the participating nations.  • A deal like the TPP involves identifying which tariffs affect **market access** and **competition** by creating a market that favors some producers over others instead of letting price, quality and consumer preference decide. For instance, it is very expensive to bring milk in to Canada, so even if you could sell your milk at a lower price, you will have to account for the cost of the tariffs, which will make your milk uncompetitive on the Canadian market. New Zealand and the US both want to see Canadian dairy tariffs lowered so that their milk producers can sell on the Canadian market more easily.  • When the market can decide and the barriers are down, we expect to see **open markets** offering **more products/services** than could previously have been made available. Prices should go down for certain products due to increased competition.  • A deal with as many players as the TPP rarely functions on one-to-one trades; instead, each party has a list of things that they want and needs to go shopping around to find ways to get their positions filled - a chain of deals wherein, for instance, Japan pressures Canada on the milk issue so that they can in turn see motion on their own priority, such as car parts. This is why the negotiations have taken so long.  • The TPP wants to **standardize** rules for trade among its participants, which cover a lot more than just tariffs and quotas. Other issues that have to be considered and negotiated include intellectual property rights and protections; rules regarding patents; environmental and labor regulations. In short, it tries to set standards on **how business is conducted**, both internationally and at home. It does this because uneven practices can result in uncompetitive market access.  • This standardization is hoped to **improve labor and environmental laws** across the board, as the need to conform forces countries that have been lagging behind in their standards to catch up with the rest of the group. By setting rules that apply equally to the US as to Malaysia, it is hoped that **people will be better off** and enjoy more protections in their working environment.  • To that end, the TPP will also have a process in place for what happens when someone breaks the rules - a **tribunal** which will decide based on terms laid out by the TPP instead of following the laws of any one government. This helps ensure that foreign companies are treated fairly and can conduct business under the same standards and with the same opportunities.   **Tl;dr the TPP is out to make business between these 12 countries more fair, predictable and even. It should provide more choice in goods and services and more bang for your buck, while making labor standards improve for people outside of North America who may be operating under less protections than a Canadian or American enjoys.**  --- What are some concerns? ---  • The TPP has been negotiated in **heavy secrecy**. While it's easy to see why keeping such a huge deal secret from the public is problematic, it is also reasonable for governments to work on negotiations and come to terms before letting elected officials decide if the end result is in the public interest. It lets others at the bargaining table know that what is said there won't be changed by a public opinion poll two days later, and it has been argued that such secrecy is therefore necessary to make these meetings work at all.  • The TPP has a **scope** that concerns many parties as it addresses trade and industry regulations on a 21st century scope - everything from upcoming cancer drugs to internet regulations to, yes, a cup of milk in Canada is all being covered by the same negotiation. It is a reasonable concern to say that the number of issues being covered in the same deal will make it hard for the public to reasonably read, understand and decide on.  • The removal of tariffs provides new foreign opportunities for business, but it also means that industries which rely on a **protected domestic market** will become exposed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that any given country is trading away the success of industry A for success in industry B, which, if all things are equal, should come down to a zero-sum game. Economics does not, of course, work like that, but it's still a fair question to examine.  • While supporters of the TPP say that it will encourage countries to improve their standards and reform, those elements are at their strongest during the negotiation - and the heat on issues such as human trafficking and human rights abuses have been sidelined as pressure to secure a deal of any kind has mounted on major nations facing upcoming elections. What should have been an opportunity to engage and demand reform as a condition of involvement in such a major global trade deal has been left by the wayside, a casualty of ambition.  --- What are the serious issues? ---  • While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, **large corporate interests** have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an **obligation** to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.  • \"Free trade\" as the TPP proposes is **nothing new** - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to **move jobs** and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.  • There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves **exceptions** in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those **standards lowered** - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business.   • Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - **jobs** - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.  • The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are **harsher than existing law**, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.  • More damagingly, the TPP **applies those laws to drugs** with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights **should** be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.  • The TPP will offer a method by which companies can **attack laws that affect them**, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.  • We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we're committed to an **all-or-nothing deal**.  **Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It's being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.**  Anyone with questions, comments, concerns, let me know here or via PM and I'll be happy to help."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: Why are we told to breathe in through our nose and out of our mouth while doing sports, meditation etc?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The nose is actually a pretty awesome organ that helps make sure that the air you breathe is prepared as good as possible for your lungs.  That includes amongst other things filtering particles out of the air (This pesky nose-hair is actually good for things!), making sure the air  gets warmed up when it is cold and moisturizing the air if it is dry. Clean, moist and warm air is making sure that it's easy on the lungs and your breathing is efficient. Additionally breathing through your nose makes sure your air intake is regulated and you aren't prone to hyperventilating.  So that explains why breathing in through your nose while doing sports, meditation and... basically in every situation is the best way to breathe in, but why is breathing out through your mouth then advised in sports?  It's mostly about the speed of your oxygen intake. Or, to be more precise, about increasing the breathing frequency. As I just wrote the flow through your nose is rather limited. That works in both directions, if you breathe in as hard as you can and breathe out as hard as you can first through your nose then through your mouth you will see that you can breathe a lot faster through your mouth. So if you breathe out of your mouth you will save a little time which means that your intake frequency of oxygen will, overall, be higher.  TL:DR: Breathing in through your nose is easier on your lungs and more efficient, breathing out through your mouth has little drawbacks and is faster. Together it's the most efficient you can breathe if you need higher levels of oxygen."

(As an aside, consider this: with both ears you can imagine how your brain could figure out where something is on the horizontal axis, based on comparing the left and right input. But your brain is also able to guess approximately where on the vertical axis a sound is coming from. With your eyes closed, if there is a click straight ahead of you, you can tell if it’s up high or down low.)  So, what hits your eardrum is never a simple sine wave. The simple sine wave can be canceled but you still hear all the slight echoes."

    "golden_answer": " As an infant our bladders just fill and release.  As we grow and our bladder increases in size and the muscles controlling it get stronger we learn to control that impulse.  At night, two things happen.  One is we release a hormone called  vasopressin that suppresses the formation of urine during sleep.  Instead that liquid gets reabsorbed into the bloodstream and less goes into the bladder.    And secondly as our bladder fills, it sends a signal to the brain. The brain sends a signal back to the bladder telling it to relax so it can fill with more urine.  As it fills that message to the brain *should* eventually result in us waking up so we can eliminate appropriately.    With kids with bed wetting issues, they often have issues with either not producing enough of the hormone, not getting that signal to wake up, or other issues."

I've read that over a period of every 7 years or so that every cell in our body has been replaced by a new cell. If you're dying or painting or doing whatever to skin/dermis cells for a tattoo, how does it remain after the old cells have died?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The ink is injected in to the dermis layer which contains nerves, blood vessels, lymphatic and various other tissues. This layer is not only much more inner than the epiderms (outermost layer), it's also heavily inundated by immune cells ready to fight foreign infections. When the tattoo ink is injected into the dermis layer, immune cells such as macrophages will immediately want to eat up or phagocytose these droplets because they are foreign in nature. The simple way of understanding it is that these immune cells cannot eat up the ink droplets due to their size in nature and will start to aggregate around the ink droplets. The ink then becomes trapped in these aggregates of immune cells that will almost indefinitely stay in the region. These aggregates will continue to stay in the region despite cellular proliferation around them. Laser removal of tattoo works by shrinking these ink droplets to small enough sizes such that they can be phagocytosed by immune cells and excreted from the system."

This is why life clusters around reefs, a lot of creatures eat the plankton and algae that grows on the coral, they provide food for the area  The waters up north are cold, dark, dirty, and full of nutrients! The darkness is partially from dirt/mud but a large part is all the algae, plankton, and krill.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: How do doctors determine what stage cancer is in and how long a patient has to live?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " **STAGING**  Cancer stages are determined by specific criteria, including the size of the primary tumor, whether or not the cancer has spread or *metastasized*, and if there is metastasis, how far the cancer has spread. These things are determined using blood tests, MRIs, biopsies, exploratory surgery, etc…  Here are the stages for many of the most common cancers. Note, however, that each type of cancer is staged differently. A doctor takes the whole picture into account, so *please take these with a grain of salt.* > Stage 0 — A small tumor that has not affected any nearby tissues. Cancer at this stage can typically be fully cured by surgically removing the tumor.   > Stage 1 — The cancer hasn’t spread to other body parts, but nearby tissues are impacted. (For example, there might be cancerous cells in the tissue immediately surrounding the tumor or primary cancer site.)  > Stage 2 — As soon as the cancer spreads to another body part, it becomes Stage 2. In this stage, the spread is still local, usually limited to the organs right next the the primary tumor. Occasionally, cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is staged here.   > Stage 3 — Like Stage 2, this is usually limited to fairly localized cancer spread. In this stage, however, the regional spread is more advanced. This stage also includes significant spread to the lymph nodes. (Lymph nodes matter because cancer cells could *potentially* travel through your lymphatic system to other body parts).   > Stage 4 — Sometimes called metastatic cancer, this stage is usually reserved for advanced cancer that has traveled to distant body parts.   ——  **LIFE EXPECTANCY**  This is pretty straight forward: life expectancy is just a game of statistics. The doctor determines your type of cancer, stages it, then looks at data for other people who had the same diagnosis. They basically take the average of the lengths of time these other people lived and bam, there’s the life expectancy.   Sometimes it’s a little more complicated than that, but the most important takeaway is that **life expectancy is *not* a prediction…it’s a guess.** Some people die sooner, some die shortly after, and other people outlive their life expectancy by several years. [In fact, here’s an important rule of thumb to remember when you read any stats about anything: *statistics tell you nothing about the individual.*]"

Ok this might sound a bit silly but, if cow manure is soil, and deserts can't support much plantlife because they don't have the proper soil, wouldn't relocating all human waste to deserts make them into normal dirt that can grow stuff? I figure at least moss or mushrooms or whatever grows in that stuff would form making it better suited for life and less deserty, right?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Cow manure is not the same thing as soil. Soil is dirt and cow manure is feces. People spread manure ON soil because as it breaks down it releases nutrients into the soil.  Deserts are made up of sand, not soil. Soil has an entire biome of bacteria, insects, and other microscopic creatures that are a part of it other than just the dirt itself.  Soil also has a fairly high moisture content compared to sand. Soil also has the roots of plants to help hold it in place.  Sand in a desert has no such structure of roots holding it in one place so it tends to blow around.   So if you put a ton of shit in the desert, it would just be shit in the desert. It wouldn’t transform into soil and would instead probably just dry out and stay there for a very long time since the micro biome that breaks down shit doesn’t exist in the desert."

What we generally think of as \"salt water\" is *way* saltier than that.   The problem with salt is that when you have two pools of water separated by a wall that water can pass through, the water will flow until there's the same ratio of water molecules to not-water molecules on each side. This is called osmosis. Our cells contain a small amount of salt. We can *eat* a small amount of salt just fine, because the water will remain balanced on each side. If we drink salt water though, the ratio of water to not-water in the gut is way lower than the ratio in the cells, so water leaves your cells to enter the gut, dehydrating you."

    "golden_answer": " Imagine that all cars, freight ships, trucks, and airplanes would move at light speed. Now think about how long it would take to send a package around the world. Of course it would be faster now, but it wouldn't come close to the speed of light. _Moving the package_ would take almost no time, but the package would still spend a significant amount of time being inspected, loaded, unloaded, etc...  This is essentially how the internet works, too. Many of the same words are used here as well: traffic, package, destination, route, ... The information _moves_ at light speed, but spends a lot of time being _routed_ or even queued. Just like you don't have a dedicated road to every person on earth, data packages have to manoeuvre through a network of shared connections.  Imagine you're a router in such a network and you receive a package labeled with the destination \"216.58.207.78\" and you're connected to five other routers. You're gonna have think about where to send this for a bit unless you would want to send it to all of your router friends, which would make the internet wildly inefficient.  On top of that, as several people already pointed out: When looking at the scale of the earth the speed of light suddenly becomes significant. Going from Los Angeles to Berlin at light speed will take 31ms. Go back and forth (that's what a ping does) and you're at 62ms. That's already enough to ruin most online games. The overhead from routing roughly doubles the travel time, so in practice you would be working with a ping of around 124ms, which will make the game feel like you're wearing oven mitts.  EDIT: As /u/HakushiBestShaman pointed out, the information doesn't actually travel through the cabel at light speed, but quite a bit slower at around two-thirds light speed. Taking that into account it seems that the overhead from routing is quite low for long distances along _common_ routes, e.g. US<->EU."

    "golden_answer": " Systemic chemicals and hormones are mostly broken down in the liver.  In addition, individual cells of many types can further process many steroid hormones - so cortisol (which is a steroid hormone = basically a fat based hormone) can be further metabolized in neurons to make a neuroactive version that does not affect gene transcription (making proteins) but membrane receptors.  Particularly an inhibitory one called GABA receptors, which also helps “calm down” activity.  These work in  manner very similar to barbiturate and benzodiazepines and are in fact currently manufactured as anti seizure meds, among other things.  Adrenaline is a no steroid hormone, cant get into cells and so binds to some receptor on the outside of cells, briefly, and then unbinds and is broken down.  Cortisol is more complicated - it can get into cells, it can be further processed or metabolized in cells, and these metabolites may also be active.  In addition there is activation of the opposing neural system (sympathetic and parasympathetic ) which will actively antagonize the effects of the hormones - decreasing heart rate for example.  So there are many homeostatic mechanisms that restore the resting functions after a stressor."

    "golden_answer": " The difference is which type of bacteria grows on the chicken. Since the chicken is cooked, any bacteria on/in the chicken was killed, meaning that only environmental bacteria will grow on it afterwards.  On the counter, bacteria from people touching the counter, dust and air, and all the other things that may be in the kitchen could make its way onto the cooked chicken. Some of this bacteria may be harmful, potentially causing food poisoning.   In your mouth, there are loads of bacteria already present, all of which (assuming you’re healthy) are not harmful to you. When chicken is stuck in your teeth, it’s almost guaranteed that the bacteria growing on it are from your mouth and not harmful to you. Also, if a bit of bad bacteria have made it onto the chicken, it’s likely that they will be out-competed by less harmful bacteria already in your mouth.

    "golden_answer": " On top of everyone else's answer, it's important to note the role that the motor oil plays in the process. Motor oil that is at operating temperature and hasn't been broken down allows the metal surfaces inside the engine to almost never touch. The wear goes into the oil and not the metal, the former being much easier to replace than the latter.  When an engine is shut off, the oil is still hot (typical operating temperature is 205°F-220°F depending on the manufacturer/design) and it's continuing to drip and cover all of the metal surfaces such as the pistons, valve springs, etc etc. Starting the engine in this state causes very, very little wear as again, it's the oil taking the wear and not the metal.  Cold, winter starts are when the engine takes the most wear, when the oil is most viscous. Start/Stop systems typically do not kick in when they detect the engine is not at operating temperature or power needs exceed a certain threshold."

    "golden_answer": " The YouTube channel Engineering Explained did a great in depth video on the subject.   It's worth watching the full 16 minute video, but the answer is that the grid would need about 25% more capacity if every single person in the US switched to electric vehicles. And the grid operators can easily increase the capacity by 25%. The electric grid from 1960-2000 increased capacity by 4% per year, so it would only take about 7 years to fully increase the grid.  As for why it can get overwhelmed by AC during heat waves, that is a business choice not a physics choice. The grid could be designed to handle any demand from all the AC. But that only happens a few days a year and not even guaranteed every year. That peak capacity is wasted most of the time. This is especially true because thst demand is only for a few hours a day even on the worst days. A peak demand like that is the hardest and most expensive way to produce electricity.

If you've ever Googled a local business, you have probably seen a graph, indicating the average traffic (Popular Times) at a specific hour, during their normal business hours.  There is also a \"Live\" function, that shows how busy they are at that exact moment. How is that information updated in Google in real time? Does someone actually manually update this information regularly or is there some sort of algorithm that makes this determination?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old:How was Germany able to take on the rest of the whole world, twice in 25 years, and even almost win\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The two \"World Wars\" are badly named: they weren't really single conflicts that spanned the globe, but several different conflicts that happened to be connected. For example, in WW2, the war in Europe was quite different from the war in the Pacific, and Nazi Germany only supported Japan because Japan was fighting against the US.  The First World War wasn't at all a case of Germany taking on the rest of the world, or even the rest of Europe. Basically, at the time, Europe had divided itself into two blocs, the idea being that if a country attacked another country, then that country's allies would retaliate -- and so, in theory, peace was assured because no country would be foolish enough to start a war. Unfortunately, political tensions were high in parts of Europe, and when a Serbian terrorist assassinated an Austrian aristocrat, this gave Austro-Hungary the excuse to issue an ultimatum to Serbia that Serbia couldn't possibly accept, and this set in motion a kind of domino effect: Austro-Hungary declared war on Serbia, so Russia mobilised its troops, so Germany mobilised *its* troops and invaded Belgium, so Britain declared war on Germany. Basically, the various European countries declared war on each other until the whole lot of them were slugging it out in the trenches.  The Second World War was primarily caused by German aggression, although Germany wasn't alone: Italy, too, was on Germany's side. Hitler secured a pact with Stalin so he could concentrate on the western front. Germany had made huge advances in military technology and had been gearing up for war for a time, and also employed, very successfully, the tactic of \"blitzkrieg\": a sudden, powerful, early strike against the enemy to overwhelm them before they could properly respond. The Allies, still recovering from the First World War, had attempted to appease Hitler; when Hitler came to power, they had persuaded themselves that he was a jumped-up lunatic who was all bark and no bite, and would never be able to actually do anything. As a result, they didn't really expect a war and so hadn't prepared for it."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [eli5] Why do you have to clean ships underbelly from barnacles?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In ships the build up of barnacles is a type of fouling  Fouling is anything that builds up on the underside of the ship and gets rid of the streamlined hull.  The barnacles make the ship a lot rougher so the water doesn't flow as smoothly and skin drag is increased, the increase in drag means an increase in required power and fuel consumption to maintain the same speed.  They'll also grow quite a lot so you can end up with *a lot* of barnacles on the underside of a ship  Modern cargo ships live and die by their efficiency.  A build up of barnacles means significantly more fuel burned on a journey across the pacific ocean so big ships generally have anti-fouling coatings on the bottom that can keep barnacles from taking hold or multiplying"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Explain like I'm five years old: Why people test cocaine on their gum line?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Ok so there are actually a couple ways to test coke without test equipment.   1. Good coke will fluff up with heat. Using either a piece of tin foil and a lighter or a microwave heat an amount of coke. It will dry out and fluff up and there should be no burnt specs just fluffy powder. The burnt specs are the cut and not the coke   2. Rubbing it between your fingers. If you take a small amount and rub it between your fingers it should dissolve completely and feel a little greasy. If there are any clumps that is the the cut and not the coke.   3. Smell. This isn't always applicable but if your coke has a smell to it. It should smell like gasoline or just a little like chemicals. But the better the coke the less smell it has. This has to do with how it's made, if it was a rushed job or it had the proper amount of time to cook.   You should follow the previous steps before you get to this point. The previous steps will help determine if your coke was cut with cheaper shit and if it has the essence of good coke.   4. Lastly you can rub it on your gums. If all of the previous steps check out you can rub it on your gums.  It should take 3 - 5 min before your mouth will start to go numb. If your mouth goes numb to quick it could be cut with lidocaine or benzocaine.   There are other ways but these are just a basic run down and what I know"

    "golden_answer": " Not all carbs are equal.  The two act very differently  when consumed.   There are some carbohydrates humans cannot even digest because we lack the enzymes, don't chew our cud, and lack the hind-gut fermenting microbes horses and pigs possess.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0q4XMzuzV4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWWTpe86ja  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yg5\\_SmLCps  If you eat an amount of refined sugar equal to what is in an apple, it's absorbed in the stomach in minutes, but if you eat an apple, those intra-cellular carbohydrates are still being absorbed in the distal small bowel hours later.  The gut bacteria treat it differently, the liver treats it differently, the pancreas treats it differently, and on top of that, you get vitamins, other anti-oxidents, and fiber.  It's true there is little practical difference between refined sugar and something like refined white flour, which is too prevalent in the Western diet, but between, say, sugar and a yam, there is a whole cascade of enzymes, hormones, and time that make a difference."

To solve this, they pass 2 layers through the rollers at the same time.  The shiny side of the foil is the side that was facing the rollers, and the dull side is the side that was facing the 2nd sheet."

    "golden_answer": " Smaller aircraft often only need one engine and you want that engine in the center of your aircraft. Larger aircraft will often need two engines or more and so you can't put two engine in the center, that's just too big and wouldn't leave you enough place for the pilot. Usually in that case, they will put those engine either under the wing or behind the aircraft on both side (called Aft mounted- engine). Each solution have their pros and cons, but usually winged-mounted are preferred because the engine are close to the center of mass of the aircraft and they are easier to access for maintenance. One of the disadvantage is that you are limited in the size of your engine by the clearance under the wing."

    "golden_answer": " There are millions of things that we see in the night sky, we can't give them all normal-sounding names, so we set a standard naming convention based on it's discovery  The first set (VVVGC1-B) refers to the survey that discovered it. Here, the VVV survey, **G**eneral **C**atalog 1B was what recorded it  The second part refers to it's sky location. J denotes the coordinate system (called J2000) and the numbers represent the center of the object in that coordinate system (right ascension of 18°14'35\", declination -38°14'32\")  So, using this naming convention, we not only have a pretty much unique naming system for anything we find, but also it tells some basic information about it as well"

    "golden_answer": " It is possible. It just takes a tremendous amount of energy - the same amount that was generated when carbon and helium fused into oxygen in the first place.   Fusing a single atom of carbon and hydrogen into a single atom of oxygen produces 7.16 MeV of energy, which is a *lot* of energy. Breaking down a pound of oxygen this way would require the *input* of at least that much energy: it's roughly that of a small nuke even if you were running the reaction at 100% efficiency."

If they refuse to work with a business, which is their right, then that company has a much more difficult time collecting the money they are due.  Likewise, customers always prefer convenience, so if using a service demands making a new account for some other service just to be able to buy something from someone else… that’s going to make them rethink things.

    "golden_answer": " Good question. You gotta see which force is acting against that pressure. The telescope is not at the L2 exactly, but slightly \"before\" so it has the ever slightest tendency to get pulled towards the sun. This gravitational force is bigger than the solar wind pressure, so you need fuel to ever stay as close to L2 as possible, not overshot.   The aft momentum flap is to counteract rotation caused by the wind pressure, and not to act against the outward force of the wind pressure: the shield is rarely perpendicular to the sun rays, which causes a rotation as the sun beam is reflected off."
