    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Just bought my first sushi knife, but I don't know how to clean it. Any more-experienced chefs able to help me out with a cheap and effective way to maintain it? (x-post from r/sushi) To celebrate my one-year anniversary in my sushi restaurant, I bought my own yanagiba because the restaurant knives get really dull from use by other employees. There's supposed to be only one person to sharpen the knives but I just found out the other employees (who are inexperienced) take their hand at the waterstone which just fucks up the knives even further.   Anyway, back to my point. As a left-handed newbie knife owner, I bought a cheap right-handed yanagiba for $20 before I commit to a more expensive knife. Immediately after one use, I noticed that it's prone to oxidizing very quickly. I keep it clean every day by scrubbing dish soap on it with the rough side of the sponge and it seems to work for a while but I have a feeling I'm doing this wrong. After a week I notice it's got a lot of tarnishes on it and has a strong smell of metal. Is this normal? What's a better way to clean knives?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Hi!  I spend 7 months in Japan for an internship, and during my time there, one of the things I did was to nerd out on the subject of japanese knifes.   First of all, japanese chefs often prefer carbon steel knives because of its superior edge holding ability and ease of sharpening compared to stainless steel. One side effect of this is that the knives rust. Leaving a knife to rust will cause discoloration. The patina is not a big issue - for many western chefs, a dark patina is considered a proof of their hard work. While the patina is not an issue, leaving a knife wet also causes the edge to rust - meaning your knife will become dull if not properly cared for.   The best and only way to prevent your knife from rusting is to wipe it when it's not in use. Even if you're just gonna leave your knife for 10-15 minutes, wipe it dry. Not \"kinda dry\", really dry. Keep a towel only for keeping your knife dry.   When I say dry, one salesman in tokyo told me to dry the knife with a hairdryer at the end of each day. While this is not necessary, it says alot of how important it is to keep your knife dry.   Also, to keep your knife clean, don't use tough sponges that might wear on the edge, use soft ones or towels together with some plain soap.   Another thing that helps you keep your knife sharp is a good sharpening steel. A common misconception is that a sharpening steel actually makes your edge sharper. It doesn't. It just re-aligns the edge after it's been slightly bent after a days work, so the edge can \"attack\" the food from the right angle.   To keep your knife deadly sharp, invest in a sharpening stone. There are different \"grains\" on sharpening stone, and generally, the lower the number is the rougher the grain is. For everyday sharpening, I recommend a 1000-grain stone and a 6000-grain stone to finish the edge. while a 1000-grain stone is enough for most people, the 6000-grain gives your edge that last bit of polish that is needed for working with sushi.   While I hate the Global-brand more than anything, it's ridiculously overpriced, and not that good to start off with, they do have a great video where a japanese chef shows you how to sharpen your knife with a stone. It's truly a great tutorial, it takes alot of practice but when you get it right, you can make your knife sharper than any professional knife shop with just a couple of minutes work.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw5ChGOADE  If you want get yourself a real, expensive yanagiba, I reccomend you get a knife from the tokyo-branch of Aritsugu. The aritsugu family has been in the sword&knife-making business since the fifteen hundreds, and this shop is where most people go from the Tokyo Tsukuji Fish Market to get knives and I've had several japanese sushi chefs recommend me this brand. The prices of their knifes aren't too bad, I got myself an incredible Aritsugu A-style 24 cm Wa-gyuoto (chefs knife) for about 150 dollars. Check it out at:  http://aritsugu.jp/   A site I learned alot from is Z-knives. That guy goes ridicously in depth in this knife reviews and even tests and compares steels used in different knives. It's a great read.   http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/indexall.shtml  If you have any more questions about caring for your knifes or buying new knives, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

I made another post a few days ago asking about how to store tomatoes until I have enough to make sauce, and I've decided to roast the tomatoes then freeze them until I have enough.   The person who shared this idea said they squeeze out the seeds (and presumably the jelly) before roasting, but I want to keep the jelly because I heard it has a lot of flavor.   So should I squeeze out the seeds before roasting and then strain the jelly through fine mesh (and roast it along with the flesh and skin), or do that after roasting, or just strain the seeds out after making the sauce?   Also, should I keep the skin in if I puree the tomatoes before making sauce, or will that affect the texture/flavor too much?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In my experience it's not really worth it to remove seeds for home sized batches.  It doesn't make a ton of difference, they don't really impact the flavor and any texture difference is small provided they are insanely seedy tomatoes.   When I've done it, it's easier to squeeze them out and strain them before cooking, retaining the gel. Over straining a whole batch of sauce or stewed tomatoes after.   Cut them in have, squeeze them to drop the gel and seeds into a strainer. Push the gel through with a wooden spoon.   You 100% want the gel. A HUGE amount of the tomato flavor, especially the glutamates lives there. Tomato anything with the gel discarded tastes thin and acidic. Often times I've gotten a mealier texture too."

    "golden_answer": " Holy moly, lots of misinformation in this thread.    The main reaction of concern here is this reaction:   alliin --(alliinase)--> allicin ---> organosulfur compounds  Alliinase is the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of alliin to allicin.  It is sensitive to heat. When the garlic is crushed/chopped, cells rupture releasing the necessary components and the enzyme can do its thing.  Heat denatures (destroys) alliinase, meaning the above reaction can't progress.    Normally allinicin further reacts (via various reactions/pathways) to form other organosulfur compounds.  Here is a diagram.  These organosulfur compounds are responsible for much of the \"garlic\" flavor and aroma.  They are also thought to do many health-related functions.   Chopping/crushing ahead of time allows the generation of ample amounts of allicin.  Meaning further flavor development later on.  It's worth noting that the reaction I just described is a general template.  Allinin has many analogs derived from cysteine.    TL;DR: Non-functioning alliinase = no allicin = no orgranosulfurous flavors/aromas."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Has anyone ever tried using dried mushrooms in the duxelle of a Beef Wellington? I've made Beef Wellington a couple times before and am planning on making it for Thanksgiving (we're not big turkey people).  Everyone seems to agree that one of the biggest challenges to make a great wellington is containing the juices that squeeze out of the filet as it cooks, so that the puff pastry doesn't sog out.  This is largely the purpose of the mushroom duxelle, and an attempted (though not very effective) purpose of the prosciutto wrapper, or in some recipes, the crepe wrapper.  But you cook down the mushrooms to get rid of as much moisture as possible, yet it still never really comes all the way out, and then they get somewhat saturated in oil as well.  So my idea was: what if you took dried mushrooms and chopped those up finely and used that instead of a cooked down mushroom duxelle?  Has anyone tried this?  I'm mildly concerned that maybe they wouldn't hydrate enough and would have an unpleasant chewy texture, and I don't want to ruin a very expensive wellington on an experiment.  Please let me know if anyone else has had this idea and acted on it, and if so how it went.  Thank you.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Buy a piece of aged beef for your Wellington. It’s much drier and isn’t pumped with water like many supermarket meats. Go to a specialist butcher than sells genuinely aged beef and fork out the cash for it. I can guarantee it won’t be soggy. Alternatively buy the firmest and driest beef you can find. And make your own puff and roll it thicker than the frozen stuff, or if you use the frozen stuff then use double. Also really really dry the duxelle out and chill it thoroughly. These things will make a smashing difference to your final result. And you will never stop some meat juices running and that’s ok as well."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does a lot of Chinese restaurant pork taste so \"porky\"? I've noticed a lot of time when I order pork dishes from Chinese restaurants, the meat has an especially strong, robust pork flavor, which I love. Of all the pork I've ever bought in a grocery store, or pork dishes I've had from other types of restaurants, most of it is fairly bland and doesn't taste like much other than the seasoning or marinade/sauce it's cooked with.   I don't think this flavor is based on any particular seasoning, or a specific cut, because I've noticed it in everything ranging from pork belly to char siu to ground pork. I eat a lot of Chinese food and I'd say about 75% of the time the pork has some amount of this flavor, and it's stronger and more likely in very traditional and high-end restaurants. For instance, the other day I got some ma po tofu from a somewhat upscale, pricy Szechuan restaurant and the pork in it was incredible. Another place where the chef prides himself on doing thing in a very traditional way has this great flavor in all their pork.  I really have no idea what it is. A specific breed of pork? Some method of preparation before cooking? Aging? I'm at a loss. The couple times I've asked, they either don't understand what I'm asking due to language barrier, or just tell me they get their pork from a restaurant supplier, which doesn't help much since other restaurant pork doesn't have this flavor.  If anyone has experience in Chinese restaurants and may be able to shed some light on this, that'd be great.\n\nAssistant:",

The package of cheap, Costco-purchased, tailed raw shrimp from Vietnam says to thaw only by leaving for a while in the fridge, and specifically says to not force thaw under cold water.  It doesn't mention microwave thawing or going straight to frying from the freezer at all.  Any particular reason why not?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Force thawing under cold water and microwave thawing are both generally considered acceptable (health-wise, in a home or food service environment) provided the product is cooked immediately after thawing. Grocery stores often force thaw as well, but that can be dangerous as the product will likely go frozen->thaw->danger zone->fridge->cook, Instead of frozen->thaw->cook.  What is really nice about thawing in the fridge is that the product never reaches unsafe temperatures. This allows you to delay cooking until needed, or if you change your mind and decide you don't want shrimp, they are reliably safe for tomorrow. Force thawing does introduce the food to \"dangerous\" temperatures (4-60 Centigrade) which are perfect for bacterial growth. Fridge thawing does not.  Tl;dr: If you are cooking it immediately after thawing (and not refrigerating again), force thawing is fine. If you are storing it between thawing and cooking, only thaw it in the fridge."

    "golden_answer": " >It seems like ever time I scrape the pan with a spatula, a small layer of residue keeps coming off.  Are you using a *metal* spatula? You should not use metal on a ceramic or enamel coated pan; silicone or wood.   Assuming you did not:  I can't tell exactly as the pan looks quite different from some of the photo angles. In this one, it looks like there could just a small layer of buildup that was baked on by the drying element of the dishwasher.   Before sending it back, you could try filling the pan with water and bringing it to a boil. Allow it to boil for about 10-15 minutes, then use a flat edge wooden spoon to lightly scrape the areas of burnt on gunk. If a black charcoal type substance scrapes off (grainy in texture), it's likely just the layer of the rub you used not the actual enamel.   This usually gets the majority of the baked on layer off, if there is still some remaining; turn off the burner and place a lid or baking sheet on top. Allow the pan to cool; after 20-30 minutes pour out the water. Get some regular baking soda and mix with a little water to make a paste. Apply this paste to the burnt areas still remaining, then use a soft sponge or cotton cloth to gently buff/polish the paste around the burnt areas using a circular motion. Start using only light pressure, and just continue to work the paste around. You can use slightly more pressure if you find the burnt layer is not coming up.   This is how I clean and deep clean my ceramic coated pans."

Drying the tenderloin before doing anything to it helps prevent sogginess and the pastry falling apart.  Your duxelles may have not been dry enough.  You may have not added the right amount of mustard or coated well enough, the mustard and duxelles should add a layer of protection to the pastry if spread correctly, with dry enough duxelles, and a mustard that isn't liquidy.  Different tenderloins will take different amounts of time cooking, and the pastry will potentially be over cooked if your tenderloin is thick or you cook it to a higher temperature.  Those are my thoughts."

    "golden_answer": " A big part of it has to do with butchery methods. If you ever watch European seam butchery which is done with your hands and a knife, you will see the emphasis is on maximizing usable meat.  In the US you see a emphasis on efficiency of cutting up as many animals as fast as possible. Band-saws galore!   In charcuterie you want to take the maximized muscle option so you can get the Coppa. The neck muscle that Americans cut off in the middle when they create the Boston butt.   In the US band-saw world you end up with ribs that still have meat on them. Actually a whole different way to ask the question is \"Why are there no good rib bbq recipes coming out of Europe?\".    So in europe they remove the bones that have hardly any meat on them, and toss them into the stock pot. In the US you get bones with your pork butt, chops, and ribs....

I want to make a variant of it that’s more interesting.  Do you think adding pomegranate molasses or balsamico for some acidity and sweetening it with honey would be wise or would that clash with the cream?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " High heat and long cooking time all increase the odds that acidity will split your sauce, plus acids are more flavorful the less they are cooked. If I were you I would finish your sauce, turn off the heat, then whisk in lemon or a splash of vinegar. Cream is a little better at resisting curdling than milk so that will help. Also, if you want to preserve the color of the sauce, you could use a white balsamic or a good-quality sherry vinegar. My advice would be to go very easy on sweeteners until the salt and acid are to your taste."

    "golden_answer": " As everyone else has mentioned, vodka pairs perfectly with caviar. Beluga vodka if you can get it.  As for the caviar itself, if you want only American caviar, I'd recommend a selection of White sturgeon, Shovelnose sturgeon and Paddlefish caviar (which should each run between $30-$70 for a 28g tin). Should you want to venture outside American caviar, you could try Osetra caviar (Russian sturgeon caviar, varying between $100-$500+, depending on the flavor profile). It's a beautifully rich yet delicate caviar that's an absolute explosion of buttery deliciousness.  If your guests adore caviar, around 14-28g per person should be good! More if you're feeling generous. And if you're serving different types of caviar, I'd recommend the serving order to be from cheapest to most expensive - that way you and your guests can really taste the difference between the different sturgeons and the experience builds up (and to be honest, I stole that idea from the chefs at Caviar Russe and Maison de la Truffe).  You'll need (preferably lukewarm) blinis and creme fraiche, and garnishes include egg (diced, separated into whites and yolks) and minced onions (generally white/purple, but I've also seen the addition of spring onions). Serve cold and, if possible, using utensils made from shell/mother of pearl/bone/glass (to avoid the metallic taste of metal utensils). Lemon wedges can be served as well - though if you're providing vodka, a quick spritz of lemon in the drinks would be lovely.  If you plan to have other food to accompany the caviar, you can't go wrong with smoked salmon, foie gras, oysters and/or lobster. Then again, most dishes would pair well so no worries there! When I was in New York, I would get my caviar at Caviar Russe - but if you already have a place in mind, their menus can serve as inspiration, perhaps? Good luck!"

I haven’t made capers in a fryer in 15 years, reminders/tips on that would be welcome.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Are your capers heavily salted?  Salt is hygroscopic. It absorbs water from the air seeking to wet out to a 75% relative humidity. I suspect that your (styrene?) portion container is not performing it's duty as a water vapor barrier (styrene is a poor water vapor barrier). If there's a little number 6 inside of a recycling triangle arrow symbol on the base of the container, it has been marked as being made of styrene.  I suggest an experiment where you put just your air fried capers in a small glass mason jar sealed up tight and wait a few days to see if your capers stay crispy. If they don't then you still have some substantial water in the capers after frying. You may have to further dry fried capers in the oven if they're coming out of the fryer still bubbling. Further frying could end up burning them so drying them completely in a low oven may be the ticket.  If they stay crisp, then store some freshly crisped capers in a mason jar with pumpkin seeds to do the same test. If they get soggy, then your pumpkin seeds are probably carrying some moisture. If the whole deal stays crispy, then I suspect that your container is too permeable to water vapor.  Toast some seeds before jarring them with your capers for a third test to eliminate moisture from the seeds before packaging.  All three tests could be done at the same time with different iterations of materials to see if you can keep things crispy with an ideal container. This battery of tests is intended to find sources of moisture in your materials.  The next battery of tests is intended to test means to package a serving of your garnish. I would do this test after figuring out how to get your materials to stay crunchy in the mason jar so you won't be fighting the moisture in the material and chasing your tail troubleshooting the packaging.  Package some of your dried material in the following ways and store them in your salad container as you would normally:  1. Styrene serving container packed as before  2. Over wrap styrene serving container in tin foil   3. Switch container materials to something else if you can find them: marked 1, 2, 3, 5, for PET, HDPE, PVC, PP, materials which are much better vapor barriers if you have started with something really bad like styrene (#6)  I'm assuming that you're doing this for some commercial reason."

The two brands that I've heard good things about are Zojirushi and Cuckoo, they are both pretty expensive. Some come with induction heating and even high end ones are pressurized induction heating. There's also fuzzy logic involved. Is there really any improvement to taste?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I finally bought a Zojirushi from Amazon, I think it was a bit cheaper that way.  It wasn't one of the fancier pressurized ones, just a middle of the road one, but one with 8 cup (note: not standard American cup size, more like 3/4 cup or 1 serving) capacity.    The first time I made regular short grain (sushi) rice in it, I was actually pretty amazed at how great the texture was.  It was perfectly cooked, e.g. no mushy areas or over dried areas.  My old cheap rice cooker that I got for $10 or $20 was so inconsistent, sometimes I got rice that was too mushy or sometimes it was too hard.  Frankly, sometimes I am even lazy with watching how accurately I fill the water up to the line in the pot and it still comes out perfect.  I think the taste is definitely better.  I use mine about once or twice a week, or at the very least, once every two weeks.  It was definitely worth the initial investment, because it is easy to clean, makes all kids of rice perfectly (imho), can be set to cook at a certain time of day, and keeps rice warm for quite a long time without changing the texture (two settings on that too, keep warm long or short amount of time).  I use it probably about as often as I use an oven, so logically it is a good investment.  Fuzzy logic means that it measures the temperature of the rice while cooking and adjusts the heat accordingly.  I think that it's a major part in the great consistency it always puts out.  The pressurized induction part, I am not sure if you would be able to improve on how well it already does with just the fuzzy logic, but I have never tried rice from one of the fancier ones, so I can't really say.  If I had to do it over, or of something happened to mine (though they have a great reputation for build quality and service), I would buy it again.  Just my two cents.  It's way way better than my old one that I got at some discount place."

Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil.   Is this a sauce that is commonly used in other recipes as well? Like a pasta or pizza maybe. Or is this something specifically for this dish\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Piperade. It's mostly tomato and bell pepper as noted in your post. You'll want a really find dice - then you don't need to blend.   If you're making the pretty confit byaldi version I recommend a thin layer of potato between the piperade and the eggplant/zucchini/squash/tomato. It adds some structure. A light vinaigrette over all with a restrained hand before baking. Don't tell Thomas Keller about the potatoes. \\*grin\\* Sshhhh."

I have a standard electric range (knob goes to 9/High), and I love to cook steaks on it in my cast iron, but if I kick the temp as high as the stove goes, it seems to burn the seasoning right off of the pan as it comes up to temp.  I seasoned the pan myself (cleaning cycle in the oven, 3 times, grapeseed oil), and it does well camping (butane camp stove), but the electric seems to get it smoking hot even at 6 on the dial.  Should I keep searing at 6, or is there something I am missing in my methods?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " An electric stove can heat the pan way hotter than you need for searing. Get a cheap infrared thermometer and aim for ~600F. My electric stove will heat a pan to 900F, which will incinerate any food you put in it and also the pan's seasoning."

I think it’s pretty common knowledge that capsaicin is responsible for heat in peppers. The Scoval Scale is fairly well known, at least among a certain sect of the culinary world. But what gives garlic it’s bite? Garlic is definitely spicy, even though it’s a different spice. Sane with onions (obvious allium connection). Same with mustard and fennel seed and all sorts of things.  What gives non-pepper things their spice?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In hot mustard, it's allyl isothiocyanate.  A kind of interesting thing: tolerance for capsaicin and tolerance for allyl isothiocyanate are entirely separate and unrelated. Thus, there are people who can eat insanely hot chilis but can't eat English mustard, and vice-versa; since they operate on totally different receptors tolerance for one does not translate to the other at all."

The menu listing included: beetroot and rosemary oil pasta topped with goat cheese. The rosemary flavor was strong, which I really enjoyed. I’m mostly interested in how to recreate the beetroot and rosemary pasta. I’m a intermediate level cook but have never used beetroot powder (except in smoothies) or rosemary oil (or have any idea where to get that).   Any tips are appreciated!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I make a beetroot pasta sauce with cooked beetroot blended with goat cheese (edit: yes it's the one from wishbone kitchen!), this could probably be made in a similar way. To keep the beautiful colour I roast the beetroots whole, either wrapped individually in foil or covered in foil in a small pan. Once they're done, a knife will go through - they won't feel soft but they'll be the same texture all the way through. Let them cool a bit and then rub them with a paper towel to peel them, the skin will slip right off. You could then blend them up with some pasta water, infused oil, salt, maybe some garlic. I have a lot of rosemary in the freezer so I'm going to try this next time I make a beetroot sauce!   The recipe I make doesn't look as smooth and glossy as yours which makes me think the sauce might be passed through a fine mesh sieve and/or emulsified with butter. This is done by whisking cold butter into a warm sauce."

The taste isn’t just a different level of salt, the overall flavor is unique. Does anyone know why that is?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It's related to how the salt molecules are dispersed and the order in which everything comes into contact with your taste receptors/olfactory senses. With salt on top, your saliva is first to dissolve the salt and spread it across your taste receptors, which gives everything in your mouth a pinch of seasoning. When salt is already dissolved in butter, it's released into your mouth slowly while the butter melts. Your receptors are getting more balanced levels of salt and fat tastes at the same time buttery flavor compounds start to warm up and volitilize.   TLDR: Taste + aroma = flavor. When taste and aroma hit at different times, the flavor is perceived differently."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Need help pumping up a German dish. My wife's family is of German descent, and growing up there were 3 girls, a boy, and the parents, so big, cheap meals were very important.  Few times a year, they'll make a dish the is essentially brats, ribs, ham, sauerkraut, and apples thrown into a slow cooker.  Honestly, it's fine.  Pretty tasty and does the job of feeding a horde.  But it all comes out the same color, and it's not particularly appetizing.  I don't want to reinvent their wheel, but I'd be curious on advice to spruce it up.  Here are my thoughts.  1.  Brown the brats and add them in towards the end.  To a further end, boil them in beer, then color them up on a grill before adding to the slow cooker at the end if the cook. 2. Sauerkraut is pretty good.  Maybe brown the ham, but cooked in some apple juice and white wine, handful of peppercorns, chopped apples, mustard seed and some chopped apples, and I'd likely be set. 3. Ribs.  This is more for the extra protein, because their not really treated as ribs.  The meat is tender to the point of falling off the bone.  If these were bbq, they'd be overdone, but I don't mind it.  They don't remove the membrane which is about the only thing I take offense to, otherwise I'm not sure how to improve slow cooked ribs.  At this point I'd probably just remove the membrane, season the ribs the night before and let them sit in my fridge.  Only reason I'm curious is that my MIL has started suggesting that as time goes by, that shed like it for me to start taking over hosting/cooking for them.  I can absolutely make it already, but the cook in me continues to look to elevate a dish.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I'd add a smoked ham hock and a couple of marrow bones, to start. It'll add richness and another dimension.  I would brown the brats and then throw the sauerkraut in the pan on high heat. It's nontraditional, but sauerkraut actually tastes great this way. You'll have to wait for the liquid to boil off.  What kind of apples are you using? Maybe you're already doing this but this is definitely a situation where you want Granny Smith rather than sweet apples.  Are there caramelized onions in this? That's another option for a bit more richness and interest.  You could even throw some caraway seeds and/or dried juniper berries for extra dimension, or try toasting some mustard seeds in oil and finishing the dish with the mixture. Just be careful with the smoke points - might be best to use lard for that."
