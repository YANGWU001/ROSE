    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do people just seem to \"know\" what certain jobs or industries pay in engineering? In my experience in engineering, engineers *love* to talk about what other engineers make. I think the fact that 3/4 of the discussion on this sub boils down to that will attest, and it happens often at the jobs I've had. I've had a variety of jobs in different industries and roles myself over about a decade of working.  I come from a blue collar background, so I was never inherently familiar with salary negotiation and white collar career growth. A decade out, I've come to notice that the people who progress faster in their career are the ones who have this sixth sense for career growth, when it's time to move, what industries are hot, and things like that. We've all seen examples of someone clearly disconnected from that sixth sense - \"I'm an EE doing embedded systems for 10 years making $65k, is that good\"? And I think I'm aware enough to know ballpark numbers of what's reasonable. But I'm interested in the people who seem to be experts at it.  Both on this sub, and in real life networking, I'll hear phrases like \"Check out Parker Hannifin, they can't hire people fast enough!\" or \"Try Boeing's electronics division, starting salary $130k, minimum\" or \"my buddy tells me 3M is starting a new location in Pennsylvania, they're desperate for people, I heard numbers like $120k being thrown around\" or \"with your experience, you should be getting $150k at least\".  These phrases are usually worded and said with the utmost confidence. And I've always wondered, where do these people get all this information? I thought the general conclusion was that Glassdoor lowballs salaries, just because it doesn't update for inflation or new market conditions. If they're talking with a friend or professional contact who's an engineer, without being the manager or the one hiring, it's very likely that they don't have the full context of what the personnel ramp up or salary range is. In the end, it seems like these confident proclamations essentially come down to anecdotal hearsay.  I did listen to a connection who told me that ASML was ramping up and that it would be a big jump for me. I interviewed and got a job offer from them...and it was within a couple of percent of what I already make. I renegotiated and they said that was the range for the position, and I didn't end up taking it.  I'm so fascinated in this subject because as we know, engineers tend not to be the type to be social butterflies, gossiping at parties about who's dating who. But the second salary and career progression comes up at work, I've seen absolute 180s in personalities and everyone seems to have a buddy who's making 150k-175k here or has salary/bonuses that blow us out of the water, and be unusually confident about how correct their \"map\" of compensation and salaries for engineers are.  I'm wondering where do these people get this information? Even after being an engineer for over a decade, I've never given my opinion on this subject because I don't know any of this stuff for sure. I'd feel embarrassed speaking with such certainty about something that I feel should actually come with many caveats. My personal career is winding and unique. People exaggerate or underrepresent what they make. But in any discussion about engineering salary, there's no shortage of people giving their 2 cents. Where do they get this information? Is there some secret Glassdoor alternative I don't know about? Is it just a natural effect where the people who are most self-confident are the ones who are more likely to speak up? Should a certain percentage of my week be spent networking with the goal of getting salary information and building a \"map\" of what different job functions and industries pay? Is this \"sixth sense\" BS, or is there a way to develop it?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Considering telling my boss that I intend to leave the company in a year. Is this a bad idea? I know what the conventional response is: do not tell your company you intend to quit unless you can afford to be fired that same day. I have seen it on this subreddit, /r/personalfinance, /r/cscareerquestions, etc.   However, I think my situation is unique. I am on a team supporting a project. We previously had 7 people. About 8 months ago, the most senior member on the team, and the only other engineer working with me onsite, retired. We knew this was going to happen, but it was still a huge loss of knowledge. Last week the project manager put in her two weeks' notice for personal reasons. I posted about how I think I am going to have to absorb her responsibility last week. It appears clear now that that is what some of the higher-ups are planning. Previously I was already sort of irreplaceable, but if this happens, I will be the most important member of the project team by far (which is a bad idea in my opinion, beer truck succession planning, etc, in addition to this being well outside of my experience level).   The timing for this expansion is also not great because in two months I start an online master's program in a different field, so I don't really want more responsibility and I definitely don't want more stress. I am a chemical engineer and the master's is in computer science, so not that closely related. To tell my boss that I am starting this program would be tantamount to me telling him I intend to quit at some point in the near future. So there is no telling him one without the other.   Part of me wants to just level with my boss, tell him of my intentions: master's program in August, leave in ~May 2020, support the project until then. There is absolutely 0% chance that I will get fired for telling him this, I can say that for an absolute fact. My company would take at minimum 6 months to get a competent replacement for the previous project manager up to speed, similarly for me. Both the project manager and myself have been working on this project since day one, so we are incredibly familiar with the details of the project. The company literally could not afford to lose both of us. There would be no one left to support the project from an operational and managerial aspect.   What do I have to gain by doing this? Probably not much besides being honest with my boss and allowing them to avert disaster by concentrating all of this responsibility on me and then have me quit in a year (less of a disaster if the project is complete by then, 50/50 shot of that happening). It could help them figure out how we are going to push the project along without putting far too much of the responsibility on me, which would probably result in a better finished product at the end of project.  What do I have to lose by doing this? Nothing really. Or nothing that would matter really. They can't fire me today. If they chose to \"punish\" me in other ways, reduced COL adjustment next year or something, the impact would be insignificant. If they hired a replacement and got them trained up and then fired me in 6 months, that wouldn't be catastrophic either. I have a decent amount saved up already in preparation for quitting. I would find some way to make some income that would allow more time to focus on and accelerate my studies.   What do I have to gain by doing nothing? Nothing. I don't want more responsibility and I'm not looking for more exposure to grow my career within the company.   What do I have to lose by doing nothing? Possible impacts to my studies (remains to be seen, but there would definitely be an increased time commitment).   Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: With the prevalence of radars and other sensors on motor vehicles, how are interferences from other vehicles avoided? Especially since RF devices have to operate in very distinct frequencies, the radar in vehicles must operate in very narrow bands presumably. Doesn't give much headway for modulating the frequency and presumably the power is set at the maximum legal level to get the best signal.    How does the sensor system distinguish between its signal and the reflected or emitted signals from other vehicles? Especially given that most vehicles have sensors that sweep the front and back for full coverage. I presume there must be a lot of cross talk.   Are they operating at a high enough time frequency to get more data points to tolerate a lower signal to noise ratio? I'm guessing the \"right\" readings will be more prevalent as the \"wrong\" one's will read values across the board.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There's quite a bit of misinformation in the responses here, so I'll try to clear up a few of them.  Firstly, the main automotive radar band is at 77 GHz (called Long Range Radar). There's a 24 GHz band, but it's being phased out.  The antennas in these radars are not typically designed to be highly directive (or line of sight). In fact, the beamwidths are relatively broad (sorry I don't remember numbers off the top of my head), and techniques such as MIMO radar are used to digitally combine them for higher resolution. And anyway, the most likely interferers (cars coming towards you) would be transmitting directly at your antennas! So there's definitely potential for interference.  There was a comment on only detecting certain signal levels. The radars are actually very sensitive, so I'm not sure what this statement is referring to. They would respond to a wide dynamic range, but techniques such as CFAR are used to mitigate for clutter and noise (I won't go into detail, but the Wiki page is pretty good; essentially it averages out the background).  Additionally, it is no longer true that only waveguides are used. While it was in the past, many new systems use planar technologies. Furthermore, frequency limitations having nothing to do with physical properties, and are solely regulatory. A simple patch antenna would have enough bandwidth for the 77-81 GHz band!   Each radar would use all, or almost all (depending on system tuning) of the bandwidth available. A very common technique would be FMCW + Doppler radar* (basically chirping the frequency in small jumps from 77 to 81 GHz), which makes processing far less expensive as you can then mix it down so your output signal (baseband) is far lower than GHz range (we don't want to use all our CPU power!). But again, because all vehicle radars will be using the entire band, there is risk of interference. Additionally, as far as I know, none of the commercial systems use any frequency hoping; it would make Doppler radar a bit tricky to compute! But what the previous poster may be thinking of is pseudo-random modulation of other aspects of the sweep, for example the delay time between each chirp. The radar would generally sweep a lot of chirps in each frame, then average them to lower noise; if you vary the delay time between each chirp, then that makes it *much* easier to figure out of a return is interference.  \\* As you send out the signal, the frequency increases linearly. When this reflects off a target, you will receive the sweep of frequencies, but obviously shifted in time. Mix these two together and low pass filter, and your resultant frequency is the difference, with a larger frequency difference implying a longer distance. Knowing your sweep rate of your chirp, you can then calculate distance to the target. There's a lot more you can calculate, but those are the basics!  So yes, interference is an issue. Imagine a received chirp isn't from a reflected scatterer, but has been transmitted from another car. It can lead to effects like ghosting (imaginary ghost cars appearing to your radar). There are signal processing techniques to mitigate for this (and it's been the subject of a lot of work). Essentially it relies on looking at the baseband (mixed down to a low frequency for processing) spectrum to understand the nature of the returns. Then the bad bits can be zeroed out to remove them, or other actions can be taken.  The response was a bit of an essay, and I was sort of trying to respond to the various answers you've already received! I've sort of lightly touched on a lot of things, but I can go into more depth on any particular bit if anyone's interested. It's an excellent question though, and definitely hasn't been easy to solve."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If the EU is so focused on Euro emissions standards, why is there not more focus on truck design? So this is gonna sound like a bit of guesswork, and it is.  However as a truck driver, I full on believe that I can *feel* the extra resistance when driving a Cabover truck versus a bonneted truck.  Plus from my experience, our Bonnet trucks got better economy over our new Cabovers at work.  The old bonnet trucks did around 650km from 400l of Diesel, these were running Mack Engines designed in the 70's, so an economy of 61.54l/100km at 55 tonnes  The new trucks are a tad heavier, I've not had one past 60 tonnes, however we get down to 350km from 400l of Diesel, which comes to 114.29l/100km on some runs.  The new heavy transporter (low loader) can get, on a good day, 200l/100km and if terrain is bad, even less, but that's in excess of 100 tonnes.  However then you go across to companies that make bonnet trucks, so for example the drag co-efficient of a Tesla Semi is 0.35, most Bonnet trucks get around 0.5 and most Cabovers get as high as 0.9  So it makes me think if anyone knows how to reduce aerodynamic drag, it would be Tesla, so they clearly picked a bonnet truck for a reason.  Now, to me, even with the DPF and DEF and all the other emissions gear, the fact that our new trucks that are Euro 5 are chewing damn near double the fuel of our old trucks at a similar weight makes me wonder, is this Euro 5 Emissions stuff actually achieving anything?  Would Manufacturers possibly see better gains from making more aerodynamic bonnet trucks? I get that you might have to knock maybe 2-4 pallet spaces off a trailer to get the overall length to be the same, to remain under dimension limits, however if you're spending half the money on fuel, surely those savings could stack up over 1,000,000kms?  For reference, our Cabovers will chew 1,142,900 litres of fuel, the old truck would chew 615,400 litres, so a saving of 527,500 litres over the life of the truck, or at current Australian prices of $1.19/l that's around $627,725 AUD per truck, so a fleet of trucks us a massive fuel saving  So looking at a cost of $2.05/km on average to operate a truck in Australia, and an average 45ft trailer so for 26 pallets that's around $0.07884615/pallet/km  So freight of 1,500km as an average would be $118.27/pallet per trip  So if your average trip is 1,500km then you would get 666 trips out of your truck per million kilometres.  So that's $78,767.82 earned by that truck per pallet space, so removing 2 pallet spaces would lose $157,535.64 over the lifetime of the truck, 4 spaces would lose $315,071.28 so even losing 4 whole pallet spaces to run a bonnet truck to a Cabover would still net you a saving over the life of the truck of around $312,654 if the fuel savings I've observed hold true.  So yeah, it's got me wondering why Euro Emissions aren't calling for more efficient truck shapes, and instead seem to focus on engines and exhaust emissions?  Is there a practical reason why Cabovers are still preferred by European truck Manufacturers and why a lot of the trucks coming out now to Euro emissions standards, even from companies like Kenworth are pushing Cabovers, with the bonnet trucks being more focused on the heavy lifting (Like the T909 being aimed at Road Train work and the Mack Titan being targeted at Heavy Haulage) where economy and emissions aren't as much of a concern?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I’m an engineer that designs exhausts along with working on meeting future emission standards. The increase in fuel use is offset by the decrease in NOx from the emissions related components. NOx has a global warming effect about 90 times greater then CO2. So the goal of the exhaust system is to get as much of the exhaust emissions back to CO2 as possible. Then the soot emission from the Diesel engine are a major contributor to lung damage and cancer, so they want to eliminate as much of that as possible. All of that is done at a slight expense of fuel economy. They are getting better about it though."

Devoid of an application - there's no way that removing material will make a shaft stronger, right? I had to dust off some moments of inertia equations and I think they must be confusing **equal weight** with **equal diameter.** Yes, I get it that there's not much \"stiffness\" in the center of the shaft. But drilling out the center of a shaft isn't going to make it stronger. Strength/weight will go up, sure. But I think they actually believe the shaft will be stronger based on some adage they must have heard years ago.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In tension and compression the stress is just force divided by cross sectional area. Solid has more cross sectional area and therefore lower stress.  Bending is more complicated but ultimately you're dividing by moment of inertia which is larger for a solid cylinder and therefore lower stress.  Torsion is the polar moment of inertia, which again is higher in the solid cylinder.  Ask him to specify how much material needs to be removed from the center to optimize the strength.

This is not what happened.  I'm a test engineer: I break things for a living. And my job does involve a fair amount of design, but I generally have 100% control over my products. I design and build test setups for anything imaginable for consumer products. Example- if your thing has a handle, I tell you how many times it can be picked off before the handle falls off.  This starts by reverse-engineering the use case of the handle- how does a human pick it up and set it down. Then, do I replicate that with pneumatics, servos, etc. Then building the setup, and using an arduino, PLC, or other to do control. Then setting up automatic data collection.  I basically build single-purpose robots that don't have to be cosmetically pretty. It's a lot of fun and I get to use hot glue more than a professional should be allowed. I made test setups that involved Tupperware that were still in use five years later.  And if I want to change something, I generally just do it.

Once it's frozen, you throw out all the ice outdoors, and refill the bucket. All the heat that was in the liquid water is now in the house instead, meaning I *must* have gained some free heating. Theoretically, this works great. In practice, I have no idea how to even approach a calculation to determine if it's a reasonable thing to do at all.  Some parts are simple. 10 liters of water seems like a manageable amount. It will provide about 1 kwh as heat as it freezes, plus a non negligible amount from cooling the water. (Enthalpy of fusion=334 kJ/kg, 10 kg = 3.3 MJ = 0.92 kWh.)  But how on earth would I figure out how much energy the freezer will require to freeze said amount?

We find new ways to integrate new science into worldly applications.  We find new ways to make current technology better (in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, and performance).  Once you realize that, then you get the gist of engineering.  What do electrical engineers do?  We cover a broad spectrum of topics related to electrical properties.  I'm a controls engineer.  I design, test, and implement circuits to make large machines controllable and predictable.  We design mathematical equations that predict how a 2-ton robot arm is going to swing at any given time, then design computers that will allow us to fine-tune that 2-ton arm.

We were considering what happens to a solar PV array when it is providing load and if the load has a cooling effect on the panel surface. I framed this as a thought problem:  Imagine you had two identical closed systems each containing a solar PV array. One was connected to a resistance heater and one was connected to nothing. Each system receives the same amount of solar radiation so energy input is the same. Since heat input is the same, both systems should reach the same equilibrium temperature. However, for this to happen in the system running a resistance heater, the only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that the inactive array's surface temp is actually lower than the one that is powering the resistance heater.  Are we both missing something here? Does a working solar panel that is serving a load reduce the temperature of the panel surface?\n\nAssistant:",

If you’re totally self-taught those four classes will give you a much more solid foundation to build on (also available for free online if you’re motivated enough), but once you’re familiar with fundamental concepts, patterns, etc. your quickest ticket to a developer job is getting good at solving coding challenges (codewars.io etc) quickly.  Also worth mentioning that the three languages you have expertise in fit in very different niches:   -\tC is mostly low-level systems/embedded type stuff -\tJava tends to be stodgy enterprise software, with the notable exception of Android -\tVB (classic) tends to either be a side item in non-software businesses or involve a lot of truly hateful legacy code. VB (.NET) is being deprecated, but if you know it well picking up C# is pretty easy and the team behind it is doing a lot of exciting things now  e: format list"

At my school the program can be thought of as a blend of Civil and Mechanical engineering curriculum. I work at a company that has engineering in its name but no P.E.s work there. Out of the 6 “engineers” 3 graduated college in mechanical engineering, and the other 3, including the lead mechanical engineer, didn’t go to college for engineering.   We develop packaging machinery, but most of it involves pumping out drawing modifications to pre existing designs, drafting.

I am an absolute animal at Solidworks and AutoCAD, and I create a fair share of custom sheet metal parts and assemblies that involve some engineering so to speak. I know some of the engineers calculate static loads to make sure the machines do not place too much weight on any one leg/support. When it comes to selecting pumps, engines and gear boxes, everyone has been doing it for so long they know what horse power and torque specifications are needed, so no calculations are really involved there.   I honestly thought going into this job it would involve more calculations, granted I am an intern, therefore I wouldn’t really be tasked with doing them, but even the mechanical engineers there that went to college say they employee their engineering knowledge about 5% of the time.

    "golden_answer": " from what I've heard, cryo-forming of large sheets was difficult in the past. now I think they can cryo-form 301 stainless sheet, which makes it stronger and more available for a project like a rocket than ever before. it's also been confirmed that SpaceX will be customizing the alloy for rocket use, and possibly doing some advanced modern \"superalloy\" stuff. I read that musk retweeted something about a alloy of steel that had some impregnation of oxygen or hydrogen or something that dramatically increase its performance. I wish I could find that tweet now.  &#x200B;  even with regular stainless, there are some good properties, when you consider building reusable rockets:- endurance limit (good if you want a reusable rocket).   &#x200B;  \\- fracture toughness  \\- fracture toughness from cryo temps all the way up to re-entry temps (SUPER important factor)  \\- resistance to heat cycling fatigue (good if you want a reusable rocket)  \\- IR Reflectivity, (for building a reusable metal heatshield)  I've been using matweb and AZOM to look up metals while thinking about this:  &#x200B;  the Falcon 9 uses  AA 2198, I think. I can't find good information on that exact alloy.  from matweb, 2000 sieries AL:  Density \t 0.0932 - 0.104 lb/in³  Fracture Toughness \t19.0 - 49.0 MPa  Tensile Strength     172 - 670 MPa  &#x200B;  from AZOM, 316 stainless:  Density   491.308  - 503.794  lb/ft3 (0.284 - 0.291 lb/cubit inch)  Fracture Toughness 112 - 278 MPa  Tensile Strength   480 - 620MPa  &#x200B;  edit: From AZOM, 301 stainless:  Density 7.83 - 8.03Mg/m3  Fracture Toughness  68 - 280 MPa.m1/2  Tensile Strength  515 - 760 MPa  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  so, if you look at F9 material (2000 series) vs Starship material (300 series), stainless is about 2.8x more dense, but tensile strength ranges from 3x stronger to around the same stregth. since SpaceX is spinning their own alloy of steel (rumor has it), I think it's safe to say that *IF* AA2198 is at the high end of that range, the steel is going to be stronger. so, the steel will be stronger but heavier, worse S/W than AA2198. however, the toughness of stainless is definitely more than 3x higher (10x in part of that range). now, keep in mind that the AA2198 would not be able to re-enter the atmosphere from mars without heat shield, so the weight of the AA2198+heatshield probably gives away most, if not all, of the yield strength to wright ratio advantage it had.  &#x200B;  now, I'm not a materials expert, I only had one \"mechanical\" materials class in college (I'm an EE). on top of that, there are more factors involved than the ones shown, but you get the picture; stainless might have been an OKAY option if you're not considering the heat-shield (heavier, but tougher); some rockets have been made with SS. now, in a world where toughness and endurance limit matters a lot more (re-use of rockets) and you have a scenario where the AL needs heat shield bus SS does not, then I think SS wins, hands down.  &#x200B;  I wish I had comparable data for carbon fiber, but it's such a different material that it's hard to compare. I do know it would have a MUCH higher strength to weight ratio, but would have a MUCH worse toughness, and again, would require heat shield.  &#x200B;  titanium is a sort of middle child; toughness and density right between the two, but with potentially better strength to weight than both, but lower service temperature and less reflective of IR (thus, not as good for re-entry). ti is also going to be harder to build/weld without losing strength, some some of the great tensile strength to weight of Ti will be lost due to weakening in manufacture. also Ti a lot more expensive.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: if you look at it, Stainless has never been far behind the other space-grade metals, but re-use, heat reflection, and active cooling put the metal over the top in terms of mission priorities. methane fuel is cheap, so re-use of the booster will save you a lot more money than you MIGHT lose on a slightly heavier rocket."

Just as an example I’m in shallow utility construction and I am often perplexed at who the hell thought of designing an electrical system the way the did. A lot of the time it seems like the person drawing up the plans for a project just wants to make things difficult for us. I know that there are regulations and that things are designed the way they are for a reason, and that it’s not just engineers but inspectors, pm’s and everyone in between who needs to do their job so that the project can be completed safely and properly however arduous the task may be once everyone has added their two cents.

Due to rushed construction schedules, unreasonable design deadlines, staffing shortages, and lack of communication this doesn't happen.  I've been to many job sites where I come across deviations from the approved plans, and a common responses that it get is that they had an easier way to built it. Sometimes their \"solutions\" are perfectly acceptable, sometime they're not great but can be fixed, and other times their work is unacceptable and unsafe. Inspectors don't catch all the issues, and even when they do, they let some things slide.  It might take a day or two to issue an RFI, ask for an alternative detail, and if it's reasonable most engineers will approve it. That's better than having the issue come up later, and having to correct the as-built condition.  This happens on projects big and small. An extreme example of this was The Harmon, in Las Vegas. On that project, the concrete sub decided that the concrete beams had too much rebar, so he removed some of it. A county inspector noticed this when **15** out of the **49** floor have been poured. The building height was reduced to **28** floors, and it was as such built, it stood on the Strip for 5 years, never opened, then got demolished"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'd take a pay hit if I take a new job; should I negotiate? Also, will I be burning bridges if I take the new job? [x-posted] I've been in my current job as a Quality Manager for 3.5 years. I had two promotions in that time and have gotten 115% of my merit bonuses each year, due to doing a good job here. It's my 2nd job out of college; I was in my first job for about 4 years. Although I'm a manager level, I don't manage anyone but interns - I have a hunch they gave me this promotion and title change so I wouldn't leave. (We have a really high turnover, so someone like me who has been here for a while is more valuable as time goes on.)  At the start of this month, I recently switched to a different area in Quality but kept my title. I just wanted a change in the type of work I was doing, a spot was open, I'd worked for the director before, so I figured it would be a good spot. Plus, I've been bored for quite a while.  Well, last week I got an email from a recruiter that actually sparked my interest. I have a phone screen today with HR before I presumably move to the next level to an in-person interview with the hiring manager.  My issues are:  1. I'd take a 10% pay hit if I take this job. (Big con.)  1. I'd have a title change back down to a Senior Engineer. (Slight con.)  1. My work-life balance would be immensely better. (Huge pro.)  1. My commute would be 40% of what it is now, and I wouldn't have to pay tolls each way. (Pro.)  1. The job responsibilities are nearly identical to the one I just switched out of internally at my current employer; the only difference is that it's in a different industry with all sorts of regulations I've never dealt with before. (Neutral.)  1. They've been looking to fill this position since November, so they are likely really eager to hire someone with my experience. (Slight pro.)  If all goes well in the interview process, I'll likely accept this job. My two questions are:  1. Would I be burning bridges by accepting the new job? I just started a kinda-new position at my current employer and I feel like I may be screwing them over by leaving so soon after this switch.  1. Given that they are likely really eager to hire someone for this long-open position, and given that I'd be taking a pay cut (and they'd be aware of this when I tell them my salary requirement) do I have an opportunity to negotiate salary, benefits, etc. with them? I've never had to do such a thing before, and part of me would like some extra compensation for taking the pay hit. However, given that my title will no longer be a \"Manager\", would it be ridiculous of me to still want to be compensated like one?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Always negotiate.  It's unusual for a company to offer the highest they'd consider paying you right off the bat.  Usually they offer you something they think is fair but in the middle of \"fair.\"  Never worry about burning bridges by accepting a better job.  You can only burn bridges by doing bad things to your current employer.  Make sure you keep in touch with your current coworkers through non-company assets like personal e-mail addresses and personal phones.  Coworkers you give a damn about, anyway.  They might want to follow you to your new gig, and it's not poaching if they come to you."

I’ve chosen a city to really double-down in with my job search, and I have been getting denied from entry-level engineering jobs there.

I like the hands-on aspect of it and I think it’s a great way to start my career (often at the same pay).   Anyways, I’ve been getting denied with no explanation at those jobs too. I don’t think my resume is the problem, because I tailor it to each job description and I have 1yr of research/manufacturing experience on top of my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering.   I had a phone interview with a recruiter for a space industry test technician role, and everything went great right up until the end of the call when he asked when I could start and I said I needed to attend graduation in early May (my grad date was on my resume) and he told me “well normally this position hires pretty quickly, 2 months is a long time…”  I’ve gotten denied for a dozen tech roles in the past week or so, so I’m just wondering, since engineering typically has some of the longest on boarding times, are the technical roles usually really quick to onboard?

I have no knowledge of guns at all but in this video:  https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/n1af77/kentucky_balistics_50_cal_exploded/  The manufacturer (I think) says normal chamber pressures would be around 55kpsi but to strip the threads like shown, would require 85kpsi. This seems like a very small safety factor. Is this correct and/or normal for these sorts of guns?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Gun barrel safety factors are around 1.5. When I first was going through the math reverse engineering a regular AR barrel, I thought this was very low too. But in the firearms industry we know the maximum cartridge pressure rating. The ammunition supplier has to ensure their ammo doesn't surpass the rated pressure. The odds of getting an overpressure cartridge are very low too. With a 1.5 SF, that fully accounts for any ammo manufacturer giving a slight defect with higher pressure.   The only problems come into play are when same cartridge dimensions are used, people reloading ammo (trying to push the limits or making an error), and cartridges with different max pressures for the same caliber (which is what I heard happened here). The first problem is rare and only happens with say you bought a .223 AR and loaded it with 5.56mm, you aren't going to have a fun time. The 5.56 has higher pressures than the .223 but both are often used interchangeably. As for reloading ammo, it is important for the individual to understand the firearm has limits and they need to ensure not to go past the pressure rating for the cartridge. Lastly, from what I gathered from without actually watching the video and reading other reddit posts about it; the ammo the guy used was rated for 85000psi while the barrel was rated for 55000psi. The ammo in question was designed for the M2 machine gun and some other .50 cals with beefier barrels. Therefore when the guy used it in his gun, which did not have one of the special barrels that can handle it, it resulted in the catastrophic failure. Thankfully I hear he is doing fine, but it is not a failure on the firearm manufacturer nor the ammo manufacturer."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can I course correct my career? I graduated with an Ocean Engineering degree in 2014.  I worked for 2 years at a small engineering company before being laid off about 4 months ago. I think it was a mix of things that lead to me being laid off. I have not been able to really find any jobs in my field in Houston since that time.  There don't seem to be any job postings for positions relevant to my experience and I am afraid I will be running out of money in the next 6 months.    As far as my experience with my previous job, I felt fairly anxious from the beginning.  From the interview, the company said they were fairly intense and had high expectations and that I would be working mainly in the marine department, but also picking up slack in the structural department.  For the first 9 months things went fairly well, but then it started falling apart.  They ran out of work in the marine department from that point on and I never really did anymore meaningful work like that again which was what I went to school for and was  a major disappointment for me.  They transitioned me to the structural department and I started getting up to speed there on a few small projects.  I enjoyed the freedom to create solutions myself, but I struggled with several aspects of the job, mainly that I was slow to produce results (mainly fab and test drawings, and load reports).  Then, I got some very tedious, time consuming, and low low low priority jobs.  I honestly think they were just biding time hoping more work would come, but it never did. I tried in earnest at first to complete them, but then they just gave me more of the same.   From here, I got very depressed/frustrated with my work.  It felt meaningless, I could never get priority on drafting rescources, and my managers would check in on me about twice a week for a few minutes top because these jobs were so low priority. I tried to bring up my concerns, but it was a fight to get anyones attention for more than 5 minutes, and I was afraid to say I was wasting my time and being unproductive.  I would get stuck often but no one would take me seriously if I asked for help, the projects were conceptually simple but logistical nightmares, so their answers were dismissive in my opinion, they would just spitball some ideas that fix one problem but created 3 more and just seemed annoyed that I was wasting more of their time.  I won't lie, it got to me and I started dreading working on these projects. I started wasting time.  I was on my phone, or browsing the web a bit, but mostly it felt like I was just staring into space hoping that something would come along and help me get through these projects. I fell behind on deadlines, made a lot of mistakes on the work that was being completed that had to be reworked or fixed later, and it all culminated in a colossal mistake that embarrassed the company although it didn't cause damage or cost too much relatively.    If i'm honest, I feel like they massively mismanaged my hiring and training process, and also that I didn't put in 100%.  All of my coworkers had masters in structural and more experience.  I would never have been hired into the role without the managers tossing me around.  There was one coworker who was exactly the same qualifications as me but a few years older, he got all of whatever work went into the marine department, and I ran support on the very limited occasions he needed it.  I could never convince anyone to make this split more fair on continue my training in that discipline to get me to the level where I could take any more of it on, I just got stuck with more structural work.  I did like many parts of my job, and I did not feel any of it was beneath me, I just felt that I wasn't suited for the structural work and that I wasn't particularly good with it.  I am at a loss as for what to do next.  I can't find a job, or even get interviews and I feel like its because my experience is this awkward hodgepodge of random things.  The oil and gas industry has been in a slump, so there arent many jobs out there anyway.  I feel like I have been working too long and that I am being passed over for entry level positions when I would be more than happy and willing to try a soft reset on my career.  I have a lot of doubt about whether my company was just a bad experience for me, because I had 1 coworker in particular who seemed to flourish in that environment and got all the marine work for himself, while I floundered.  Is it me? Was it legitimately a lack of work and just poor timing like they said in my exit interview? Am I cut out for this career, or should I try and find something else before I run out of money/time?  Is this experience normal? My biggest fear is that I get another job and that this is just standard practice, and I am not cut out for all of this.    I guess I am just looking for reassurance, advice, other perspectives. Anything really.  I learned a lot from all this and I have been forced to really look inwards and evaluate what I need to fix, and I am willing to do it.  My family and friends have been a huge support, but getting fired really has brought up a lot of self-doubt about whether I can be a successful engineer.  I just remember being anxious from the beginning and having some success, but then it just started going wrong, and the anxiety buit and built and it became self destructive, and then I got fired, and now I just don't know how to put myself right.

I'm a long time car guy, certified engine machinist, automotive nutcase. Something I've been having a hard time with recently is horsepower. This all came about because I was discussing gear shift points for maximum acceleration, with some fellows on the interweb. Many people were of the erroneous understanding that the best time to shift for maximum acceleration is at peak hp, however the actual answer is based on current torque x current gear ratio compared to shifted torque x shifted gear ratio.   What really stands out to me is that from a peak acceleration perspective, hp has literally no part of this calculation. Which then made me wonder, why on earth do we care about hp then? All you ever hear talk about is hp, and many manufacturers go out of their way to prioritize peak hp over ample torque, especially when designing a race oriented vehicle.  I've watched videos before explaining what hp is and why it matters, but I feel like they always glaze over most of the important details and skip right to the end result.

The ones I've worked with were very talented (most of them) and face basically the same challenges western engineers face. The engineers I've worked with genuinely want to make great products and show pride in their work. I have learned from them and they have likely learned from me.   When it comes to copying, its largely out of their hands. Since its not culturally taboo, its not an ethics question (unless things are known to be unsafe). It's not even illegal, so if you base your ethics on law, that's your problem (I don't expect foreign companies to submit to Chinese law).  Re: Superfish. Do you really think that was an engineering decision? Have you ever been bypassed on decisions because its a business decision, not an engineering one? Its not as if Chinese companies are the only ones doing this stupid shit (anyone remember Carrier IQ from a couple years ago?).  All this aside.... I'd certainly prefer it if copying wasn't a thing to contend with. At the same time, you've \"made it\" when soneone does copy you.

I don’t think what I put into a German pension came anywhere near what I would’ve put into my 401k in the US, and I certainly wont get as much out as if I was managing the account myself.   The city I lived in is basically always ranked in the top 5 cities for quality of life in the world for any year I have looked and I believe it.   The company I worked at was very focused on keeping employees happy, and very big on work life balance. In Germany in general it was illegal for me to work more than 10 hours a   day, I had to get special authorization to work on Saturdays (which never happened anyways), and it was completely illegal for me to work Sundays. It was also illegal for my average work load over a few months to be above 40 hours a week. I also had the option to work 35 hours a week, of course getting paid for 5 less hours a week, along with prorated vacation benefits.  When I got this offer and told my US company I was going to accept, they said “how does anybody get anything done out there with all these laws” which really put in my mind the difference in focus on individual vs company for me.   I wanted to get out there and travel while I was still young, and until covid lockdowns it was a great experience for me, and for me it was worth taking the pay cut to live out there. I will say until you know the language it gets very lonely, not only are you living in a foreign country very far away from all your family and friends, there is a language barrier that makes it much harder to meet friends. Even the simplest of chores becomes a huge burden with the language barrier, and at least for me always having to translate in my head would be mentally draining.  As someone who likes traveling and enjoying new things I would say do it if you can. You can likely move back and get a bay area job in a few years as well, if and when you are ready to move back. If you want to travel through Europe it is cheaper to live out there and travel than to vacation from the US."

We'll use this approach. It is all predicated on the client providing us these design inputs. It will take 160 hours.  *Two months pass*  Project Lead: We won the work. We had a kickoff meeting last week that I forgot to invite you to. So the schedule actually started ticking last week sorry. Oh and you have 120 hours.  Shake: Great.

I have to go into a status meeting for the project in 15 minutes.  Shake: I haven't worked on it at all.  Project Lead: Wait, what? It's due this week!  Shake: I still don't have the design inputs I asked for.  Project Lead: Oh yeah, those. Did I not tell you? I asked them about it and they said it would be too much work to pull all that stuff together. Can you make do without them?  Shake: I guess I could make a bunch of conservative assumptions that consume the entirety of the design margin, show the design barely meeting the regulatory requirements, and absolutely fucks the next person that has to revise this calc, which is probably me in like 2 years?  Project Lead: Sounds great.  *Sends calc to client for owner's acceptance review*  Client: Why is our margin gone?"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Should I quit my current engineering job at a startup? This is my first job out of college and although I love the culture and stuff I do I don’t enjoy the pay. I think certain fast food places pay as much as I’m being paid currently. I recently reached a year with the company and asked for an 8k raise. My boss said that the company doesn’t have enough money to bump me to 50k even though they just received a large amount of non-diluted funding which they used to bring in a senior engineer for 120k (well within the market price for him). He said the best they can do is adjust for inflation, about 7%. I currently have a buffer building out a solidworks curriculum which can support me for a month and I have connections to do construction which would pay me more than I make now until I find another engineering position. So should I put in my two weeks now or suck it up until I find an offer?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " 42k is terrible money as an engineer. The only way this would be maybe ok is if you’re getting a bunch of stock options which could be worth a lot. Its up to you if you’re confident enough in your backups to quit right away; but I probably would."

    "golden_answer": " Not an engineer (a speckled beard millwright), but I'm going to pipe up and talk about working closely with your builders/skilled trades people and respecting opinions. I've worked with a whole lot of hot shit green engineers who think they know everything because they spent 5 years staring at books. Your trades guys have spent many years actually building stuff, and they have a different skill set than you.  Do understand that often designs are guidelines, and you need to work closely to make sure that the original parts that matter stay within spec. But your builders will evolve your design. Especially in Canada where our trades training is so in depth. If your guy has a Red Seal, he probably knows what he is doing. Chances are your builder knows how to put together a whole lot of stuff better than you. He's a second set of eyes with a different perspective than you.   You can spend a career fighting this fact, or you can spend a career making some good relationships with trades. Respect opinions. Ask questions, but give them some freedom to build as they see fit and evolve your designs. Work with them, not against them and don't be afraid to learn from them. They way you were taught in school is often not the way it is done. Watch and learn.   You may design a system one way, but your guy knows how to modify your design so you can actually work on it later. Building repairability into a design is critical, and nobody knows how to maintain and repair a system better than the guy who actually builds and fixes it. Buy that guy a beer every now and then, and he'll give you solid feedback. Listen to it."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is “Engineering (Robotics)” too general of a degree? I’ve been in talks with ASU advisors to transfer there for a BSE and am unsure about where to specialize.  My interests are, in summary, robots and rockets. I’m hesitant to pursue aerospace engineering as I’ve read it’s a niche, cyclical market, and I care first and foremost about getting that first job after college.  ASU has an undergraduate program in Robotics Engineering titled Engineering (Robotics). Even though the curriculum itself appears to be catered specifically toward robotics and mechatronics, I’m wary of the title of the degree as I’ve heard terrible things about “general engineering degrees.”  That leaves me at MechE. It’s kind of the perfect safe middle ground between my two interests. The only thing holding me back is motivation: I feel like I’d be more motivated knowing I was working toward, well, robots and rockets.   What are your thoughts on engineering (robotics)?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I probably would not hire someone with a \"Engineering (Robotics)\" degree.  Not because there is anything wrong with it per se, but rather, because I don't have a good feel for what that means.  Did the guy study control theory?  Circuit design?  Machine learning?  Structures?  Power trains?  There are so many topics that could fit under \"robotics\" that I'm comfortable saying that no degree could cover them all.  Result?  I have no idea what I'm getting when I see \"robotics\".  Meanwhile, when I see EE, or ME, or CS?  Yeah, I've got a pretty fair idea.  As a result, if I'm looking at giving an interview to one of two candidates; one of whom has a degree that aligns with what I'm looking for and the other who has a degree that leaves me scratching my head?  Yeah, the head scratcher isn't getting the call.  He may actually have been the better candidate, but I'm not a gambler; I take the safer bet."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Do you feel that the skilled trades as a career path is undervalued/underappreciated concerning today youth? Hey guys, as an engineer that has worked at a variety of manufacturing companies, I have noticed how great of a life/satisfying it can be to work as a skilled tradesman. However, I can't help but to see a stigma attached to it when concerning the youth of today and their parents.  In this day in age, I find that more and more kids that are interested in technical work are pushed to go into university for any STEM field while the \"dummies\" are left to go to college and become tradesmen.  Just talking to peers, I find that the overall perception of tradesmen are the electricians that hook up your electricity to your house, plumbers, HVAC guys and mechanics that work at small shops. \"Joe\" jobs.  I find it frustrating that they don't understand that many of these tradesmen are extremely technically competent and can work on amazing projects like plane, ship and mining/manufacturing tooling construction for the top tier companies in the world (boeing, apple, catapiller). Most I have seen get paid more than engineers (some upwards of 200k) and can transfer into management as well.  I have worked before in Germany (I'm Canadian) and have noticed that the tradesmen are much more appreciated there than in north america.  This frustrates me because there is a huge demand for tradesmen while I am starting to see more and more young engineering graduates struggle to get jobs. I feel that the current schooling system puts a huge negative bias towards the trades.  Thoughts?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It's all about the money.  While some skilled trades in some areas and some levels of experience can make more than early career engineers, on the whole engineers make more and have better prospects for top end pay.  And typically the engineering work environment and benefits are better.    Wherever an employer complains they can't find skilled trades to hire, I see an employer who doesn't want to raise wages.   Kids looking at career prospects can tell which way the wind is blowing. You can tell them all about how cool it is to be a carpenter,  but all it takes is seeing a framing crew out in the snow in November working 10 hour days and then being laid off for the winter to change minds."
