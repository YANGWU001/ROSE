    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is this Coronavirus Work from Home Policy Normal? I work for a large consulting company and have two kids. They just sent out this WFH policy that I find tone deaf in the current climate. Is this even reasonable?  **Tips and Guidance for Working from Home**  1. Unless your office is officially closed, be aware that you can still work from the office. If doing so does not increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19, you may choose this option because of activities at your house, a lack of dedicated work space, or you just need a change in environment. 2. Daily check-in calls may be beneficial, especially for those that aren’t accustomed to working from home. However, this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, because the downside is that these calls may interrupt the flow and concentration of working on projects, and may add to an already busy meeting schedule for many of us. 3. Maintain an accurate calendar, especially involving time out of the office. 4. When you receive an email from another employee, acknowledge its receipt in a timely manner and provide a time estimate as to when you can provide the information or action requested. 5. If you have a critical deadline or time-sensitive issue requiring another team member’s response, consider placing a follow-up voice call to ensure that the email will be seen quickly and that the deadline is understood. 6. **Use the seven-day week to your advantage. What can you accomplish on Saturday or a Sunday?** 7. **Leverage early morning and evenings.** 8. **Swap babysitting responsibilities with other parents in the same situation.** 9. **What if the daycare closes? Consider hiring the teacher who now can’t work! Or college and high school students who may be similarly impacted.** 10. It is essential that you adhere to all data security protocols.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Just sounds like they are offering flex-time arrangements for parents who have kids that are now out of school and have to be cared for. At most companies, work-from-home policies usually prohibit taking care of your kids at home while telecommuting, as it's a huge distraction and would no doubt have a negative impact on productivity. Seems like they're giving you suggestions to work around that if you do have kids that need taking care of; you can spend time during the week minding the kids during work hours and make up any of that missed time or unfinished work during your evenings and weekends."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [FR] Overly demanding job resulting in severe mental health distress I work in PR in a 25-people company I joined only 6 months back. The CEO is a young woman of about 35 who appears to have some trouble managing expectations, employee workload and customer complaints. A few months back I was working in a 4 person team, and I estimated my workload at around 120% capacity. We dont get paid overtime, but I still worked longer hours in order to keep clients happy. Of the other 3 people in my team, one has since quit, the other went on a long holiday and the third got Covid. Three new very important and time-consuming projects were also added to my workload, which means I'm at around 200% capacity. My absent team members were not replaced, and several clients got seriously upset at the decrease in quality of service.   I started to feel down in the dumps and drained all the time. I talked to my bosses and provided them with a list of my weekly tasks with an estimate of time needed to accomplish each, and it added up to an 80 hour work week. They offered no solution, because apparently no candidates reply to their job offers. I routinely started getting yelled at by clients and my bosses alike whenever the quality of my work was not up to standard. I started sinking lower and lower, and my preexisting anxiety and depression began to take over.  It's 9pm on a Friday and I'm having dinner when I get a call from the CEO. She's screaming mad because a client called her in a rage - I apparently set her a press release formatted in the wrong font. I threw up my dinner. But still, I offered to fix it and send it back asap. I thought this would fix it, but my boss announced that the COO wants me in her office Monday first thing in the morning for a good old yelling session.  I can't take this anymore. I'm having very dark thoughts.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Hi - I've been in your position. I want to start off by saying - people telling you go to go t a doctor are well meaning but completely off base. No amount of therapy or drugs can help \"cope\" in that type of environment. It's a ridiculous thing to even infer that you should be able to \"cope\" or even slightly \"deal\" with this better.     I'm telling you as someone who ended up being let go after giving my entire self to a company with a very similar sounding CEO and bosses - quit. Quitting was something I had thought about but was playing it safe and not willing to quit without a job offer. the thing is, i had no time to do applications or interviews because of my work load. I was tired, I was angry, I would cry constantly. Seeing picture of myself during that time, I look like a dead person walking, and I had only worked there 7 fucking months. I finally was open about how I was feeling in an upfront, direct way: I couldn't take more on, I needed support. I told them that on a Thursday. I was let go the Monday after I said it. It ruined me for at least a year - I found another job quickly enough  but left that one at 2 months in because I just couldnt handle anything. Getting fired was them taking the last bit of me - the sense of ANY control I had was gone because I told myself I would quit and that was the power I had. It was awful.     I'd prepare to resign at that meeting with the COO. I'm telling you it wont get better (and I think you know that). Any attempts to even hint that it could WILL take 6+ months to see any type of movement if any and if you bring it up again, you'll be told to \"be more flexible\" and be a \"team player\". Don't buy it. The company that fired me kept going downhill after I was let go. My entire team was either fired or left shortly after. The company still exists, the CEO is the same and now years later, It's the most traumatizing experience I've ever had.     Go into the meeting with the COO. Quit your job. Be polite. Give 2 weeks notice, DO NOT GIVE MORE because they will take it. DO NOT work at 200% during those 2 weeks - they're going to hate you no matter what you do. Accept you won't get a reference from the CEO but you can ask other people from your team even if they aren't a supervisor (this is accepted by the majority of places, I've tried it!). The next couple months while you apply will be tough, but you will feel so much better you won't even notice.   &#x200B;  I'm sorry you're going through this. You don't deserve it and you're good at what you do. Take the red flags you've seen and make sure you watch for them else where (and they are everywhere!). Good luck."

The story is 10 years old.  If your employer fires you because of this story, you could file suit with the new hire due to the damages of financially losing your job. This is why you want to lawyer up.   Also, your lawyer could serve the new hire with a cease & desist, which is a piece of paper saying “We encourage you not to continue in this action, or we will be filing suit.”   Because them getting fired isn’t going to stop them from being a nuisance and spreading the story.

We were supposed to FDA approval on a medical device in June that did not come through and they are being hush - hush regarding the deficiencies and plans moving forward. The company seems to be struggling financially and have been terminating long time (higher paid) employees without warning, or explanation. I have seen this coming so I secured a position with another company. I do travel for work and my schedule was booked through August so I was gracious enough to give six weeks notice as to not leave the company or my teammates in a bind. After 3 weeks, they gave me a termination notice citing that is their right to exercise in an \"at will\" employment state. I live in Az, company based out of Tennessee.) It is apparent they did this in order to not pay out my 60 hours of PTO I have stored in my account. The employee handbook says that if you do not give adequate notice or are terminated, that you do not get stored PTO.  I do not find this practice fair or ethical, as I worked 3 weeks after my resignation as a favor to the employer. Is there any recourse? What should I do? Can they continue to get away with this?

I loathe having to ask this, it feels like the most petty situation on the planet, but it’s becoming a major point of contention among my staff, and as a manager I don’t know how to handle it.   Background: Small non-profit, 10 person staff. Of those 10 staff 9 are females and we share a women’s restroom. It’s a private one toilet with a door restroom.   We have a newer staff member who will go into the restroom for 15-20 minutes at a time 3+ times a day. To the point every time someone else tries to use the restroom she is in there.  At first we though, maybe it’s a temporary thing, not feeling well, etc. However it has not improved, if anything it’s more frequent/longer times. Other staff members have come to me complaining and more recently started gossiping and complaining to each other about it. Every time we go to look for her to ask her to start a different task she’s in the restroom, and she’ll be in there for extended periods while others need to use it. They could use the men’s, they’re essentially unisex bathrooms, but they don’t want to use it after our male employee(understandably).   It’s turning into a major issue with staff and there is growing animosity. Today the employee in question and I were the only ones in office and I had to manage our front deskthat’s within eyeshot of the bathroom, so I started a log. She spent 1:27 minutes of her 8hr shift in the restroom today.  It’s certainly at the top of my list that this could/likely be a medical problem. The LAST thing I want to do is manage someone’s restroom breaks. We’re grown adults, go when you need to, blow it up (and clean it) if you need to. I have bigger fish to fry, but we’re past the point of being able to ignore it.   Please, please help me out here.

My husband is an HVAC tech who got laid off because of what's going on with the pandemic, however his company is still requiring him to go on call on the weeks that it's his turn? He'll be collecting unemployment, so can they do that?  We are located in Vermont.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " This is some next level scummy business practice. You can either have someone working or not. Laying someone off means they are no longer your employee. They lose all benefits so you do as well.  Also if they’re a small company they’re just trying to abuse your hubby. I’d assume they still have salaried employees on staff and those people will be the only workers that can field calls. Otherwise your husband isn’t covered under workers comp insurance if he is injured. And in HVAC that can happen anytime between heavy objects to high voltage electrical. I know he wants to get his job back after this is all over but I’d say fuck you straight to their face.   My job cut us back to 16 hrs a week so we can still have some pay and benefits. We’ve also created teams so that only teams work together and if one of us gets Covid-19 they remove all of us from the property."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Received vag pills from co worker for Christmas, among other uncomfortable things. (NJ) At my wife's secret Santa exchange she received, from a male co worker,  a box of probiotics thats 1st claim was \"improve vaginal health\", written boldly on the front, and more pills for eye health in women 50+. She is no where near that age. These gifts were opened in a communal setting,  in front of everyone.   I can't help but to read a mean prank in this,  \"haha, here's something for you, old bitch, and your pussy probably stinks!\" , hidden behind a facade of \"oh, i didn't realize.  Don't be so sensitive \" Later that day, her cunty male svp asked her team how was the exchange (wife wasn't present for this meeting). They told him what happened with my wife. His response was, \"thats unfortunate \". After the meeting,  he called my wife, at her desk and asked if the \"gifter\" was around and could she see if he was at his desk.  My wife is not a secretary,  she is a director.  The gifted is in a totally different dept, with his own team. I read this as a cruel joke to make her interact with the guy that obviously she was disturbed by. When svp held another meeting later that day he again asked, how was the exchange, with a chuckle, to the same group as the last meeting with the only difference being that my wife was there this time.  I don't expect  a lawsuit,  but what is her recourse to expect changes? She is the only black woman in a leadership position in a gigantic Korean company and is consistently treated differently.    I.e  Her svp just asked her to do a presentation with bullets to bring to her 1 year review of how her years production went. No one else was asked this.  Help before I let my hands and feet explain to them that this isn't ok. Thanks\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " HR Director here. I am so sorry that this happened to your wife. This Secret Santa gift could easily be sexual and age harassment, plain and simple. It doesn't matter if the guy who gave it to her thought it was funny, if others thought it was funny, or your wife \"went along with it at the time\".   She needs to document all of these other instances and see what the complaint procedure is at her company - it should be in the employee handbook. Then she should make a complaint to HR. And she should continue documenting, because I would bet that there may be some retaliation against her, which is also very illegal.   If they try to fire her, discipline her, or in any other way make her work environment hostile, she needs to consult an employment law attorney with all of her documentation of the incidents. If there are any other people she knows who have left the company  under similar circumstances, she could also build a case there. She may not keep her job there, but she'll walk away with some money and knowing that she stood up for herself and probably lots of other people who have experienced the same.   If your wife is an SVP I'd bet she's pretty smart, so she doesn't need me to also tell her not to sign anything her company may give to her to try to keep her quiet or intimidate her - a severance agreement, a performance improvement plan, etc. Good luck!"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [WA]Employer failed to notify my husband of FMLA eligibility and now he may lose his health insurance In February of this year my husband developed a heart condition and needed a month off while it was being diagnosed. He submitted multiple doctor notes to cover the mostly unpaid leave. His employer did not notify him that he was eligible for FMLA and he just went back to work when he was able to. At this point he had sufficient worked hours to be eligible for FMLA.   In August, he needed an additional two weeks off to have a defibrillator implanted. We had become knowledgeable about FMLA at this point and asked his employer about it, per their direction, he contacted the third-party benefits company Leave of Absence dept and followed their instructions to file for the leave. He was denied FMLA due to insufficient hours worked in the last year and they instead provided ADA leave forms for his doctor to fill out. His doctor did so and the ADA leave was approved.   However, this employer determines eligibility for each year’s insurance based on how many hours have been worked in the previous year and he will not have the required hours. Given his medical condition losing his insurance at this juncture would be disastrous. Open enrollment is in November  for coverage starting in January. They have not specifically stated he will lose insurance but they keep repeating the number of hours that are required and he falls well short of it.  We have talked to his employer and to the third-party benefits department about the fact that he was not notified of FMLA eligibility in February and his right to continued health insurance would have been protected if FMLA had been provided to him at the appropriate time. His manager tried to retroactively put in his FMLA for February but the third-party company refused it, saying it should’ve been done in February. Neither his manager nor the benefits company  seem to acknowledge that it was their responsibility to notify him of his rights under FMLA back in February. Is the only recourse here contacting the Department of labor?   I’m leaving out many details about how slow, unhelpful and cumbersome the processes are in this  3rd party company. We have kept all records of phone calls, conversations,  paperwork etc. etc. Thanks for any assistance or guidance.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Assuming he was eligible, your husband has all of the protections of FMLA in February, because his manager knew that he needed time off for a serious health condition and the company was therefore required to offer FMLA.  By refusing to retroactively provide FMLA coverage, the company (via the third party) is engaging in FMLA interference which is not lawful.  If they then revoke your husband's benefits because of it, then it is also FMLA retaliation which is equally unlawful.  Contact L&I and file a claim.  It's free, easy, requires no attorney, and you can do it online.  This is all assuming that you are correct that the missed time in February would make the difference in hours between maintaining and losing benefits."

Twelve years ago, when I was hired by my new employer, I was provided with a company car to visit customers within a tristate region. The car was an important element of my negotiated hiring package. I have also been allowed to use the car for personal use. A few years ago, my employer was purchased by a larger competitor and I was still provided a company car. It's been a great benefit: I pay $50 per paycheck for the use of the car and that includes a fleet gas card (free gas!), no costs to me for maintenance or auto insurance, etc. And, about every three years or so, I am provided with a new replacement vehicle. This wonderful benefit is going to end within the next couple of months. Question: Should I ask my employer for some additional compensation to help compensate for the loss of the car going forward as the initial car was part of my hiring package? If yes, how should I proceed? My business travel needs haven't changed, and, in fact, my business travel will increase in 2022 and going forward.

To add to the story, I haven’t received my review in writing but plan to ask on Monday. Im also going to email a response to the review on Monday as well. Not sure how to move forward if I cant prove what was said. Im also debating whether or not I should speak to Amy’s boss when they come on Monday and how shes creating issues at work.

The first time she interrupted me, I let her know to let a supervisor or someone else in the office to sign for it. She came in a second time to ask about the vendor again, this time I had to be firm and remind her I am at lunch.

I explained to my director my side and they were shocked at how different the two stories were. I defended myself by telling her that I was just enforcing my boundaries and gave a few examples of my own of situations where people just walked all over me. Again they were shocked and I could tell embarrassed from not knowing the full story and being so quick to judge.

(new york) I've been at my part time retail job for 4 years in two different stores. I got my degree a year ago and recently was doing an internship in my field while working my part time job as a floor supervisor. then, my district manager (who is my store manager's superior) offered me a promotion to a full time position as assistant store manager at my old store. i was unsure at first but ultimately i decided to leave the internship and accept. i essentially just overworked myself and burnt out doing both jobs and did not like the boss at my internship and decided that I would not work full time there, so I took the assistant manager role. that position will start beginning of February.  basically, i found out from a sales associate that she has been complaining about my performance, saying that I've been doing badly and making mistakes, and that she wanted to DEMOTE ME because of my limited availability from have the internship. the assistant store manager at my store is friends with this sales associate, so that is where he got all of this information. i had literally no clue that she felt this way at all. i was honestly shocked to hear it and so upset that she did not come to me and tell me that there was a problem.  i also feel embarrassed because i'm sure she spoke to other managers about me and complained, meanwhile i'm being offered a promotion that, clearly, she does not think i deserve. neither her nor my assistant manager came to me and said a single word about me doing ANYTHING wrong. like, not a thing. i asked her multiple times if me having both jobs was an issue, and she always said no.  is this grounds for going to HR?

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [MD] Conflicted about firing someone at the end of a PIP I manage a team of close to a dozen IT analysts at a large organization. A few months ago, I had to put one of my employees -- let's call them Francis -- on a PIP after repeated attempts to help them improve their job skills were fruitless. I tried coaching Francis intensively for months to no avail and it had gotten to a point where their lack of technical aptitude, inability to follow procedures, poor grasp of professional boundaries/workplace etiquette, and abysmal communication skills were taking a serious toll on team morale and my own mental health.  I should have taken action much earlier, but I had never dealt with a PIP before and stupidly hoped my coaching and frequent, specific feedback would suffice. It did not, so at the end of their negative annual review I told Francis I was initiating a 90 day PIP. I have been meeting with them for an hour or more every week since then, and while they have made some small improvements here and there, they have been minimal and inconsistent, and only after extreme hand-holding by coworkers or me. Multiple team members have expressed their frustration at having to pick up Francis's slack; they were all eager to help them at first, but everyone has eventually given up on teaching them anything because nothing sticks.   I know they have been trying, but I've suspected for a while that they have some kind of cognitive impairment based on their behavior, lack of listening or reading comprehension, work output, and poor judgement. When they divulged some medical history that could possibly be pertinent (without prompting), I tried encouraging them to pursue reasonable accommodations, but they declined. And yet several times during PIP check-ins, Francis cited their medical history as an explanation for poor performance.  I've been as clear and candid as possible with them throughout the PIP about how they still haven't demonstrated an ability to meet expectations for the position and that they need to show much more significant improvement on a consistent basis to succeed in the PIP, but they don't appear to understand what that means. I've tried everything I can think of to get through to them, but it just feels like talking to a wall, and I have concluded that they simply are not capable of doing this job.   About 60 days into the PIP, Francis had a unexpected medical emergency resulting in a month long absence, so I had to extend the PIP period. To be honest, prior to this I'd been counting down the days to the end of the PIP because I couldn't handle the intense frustration of managing them anymore. My job is extremely stressful even without Francis, and I've been struggling with burnout for the last year, so I felt resentful about having to prolong this misery even further. But I also felt really sorry for them and the idea of firing someone right after they returned to work from a serious medical crisis just felt gross, so I tried to give them a fair chance.  So now we are approaching the end of the extended PIP and Francis still hasn't proven they can meet the basic requirements of this job. I have no doubt I'm justified in terminating them and I have tons of documentation to back me up. Here's the problem: based on what they have disclosed about their current medical condition, it's pretty dire. They haven't shared a diagnosis (and I would never ask) but recently they have mentioned several details in passing that indicate a grim prognosis. They have also disclosed in past conversations that they have some mental health issues in addition to this condition, and I've gotten the sense (from their chronic, intractable oversharing) that they don't have much going for them outside of this job. From a professional standpoint, I know letting them go is the right call for my team, and personally, it would do wonders for my own stress level to have Francis out of my life. But morally, I feel sick about terminating someone in their position, especially knowing that they almost definitely have astronomical medical bills (with more in the future), even with insurance.  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the conclusion of the PIP? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? If so, how did it work out? I would appreciate any words of wisdom.\n\nAssistant:",

It would also be used if anyone needed to make any sort of trip for the company's reasons on company time. Well this week my boss sold it.

When the weather is good I like to ride my bike and the weather has been amazing here the past couple weeks.   Anyway my boss came back into my office several minutes later telling me to go with my coworker in his car to my house to get my truck so we can go get the supplies. I lied and told him my wife took the truck to her sister's place like 1.5 hours away. He put his hands on his hips and shook his head visibly getting more annoyed. Told me I need to bring my truck in on Monday and he'll let me know ahead of time the next time that we're running low so I can make sure that I bring my truck in.
