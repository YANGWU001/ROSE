At the end of the game, we ride a warthog through the entire length of the ship to get to an open space where Foehammer can come and pick us up, and when that fails, we go to the launch bay and get the Longsword. The first thing that doesn’t really make sense is the platform out in the open, which could just be because of the damage the ship took when crash landing. But I’m still confused as to what the practical use of a long corridor that goes the entire length of the ship could be. It could be a maintenance tunnel, but that doesn’t really make sense either since there isn’t exactly a straight path and there’s tunnels in random places, and jumps in others.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It is also, in game, three times the length of the ship. Halcyon's are 1,170 meters long. The Warthog Run is around 3,400 meters (And this distance doesn't even take us to the prow, but to a hangar roughly amidships).  Basically, this segment of the game doesn't represent the PoA at all. The open area Foehammer is supposed to evac us from doesn't exist from an exterior view, and would make the ship split in half the second it came within range of any kind of gravitational force."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [MCU/Marvel] Why do superheroes not collaborate more/share resources in the marvel universe? I've been thinking about this alot especially as a big fan of the marvel movies. Why do the superheroes not share resources/technology or aid more with one another in the marvel universe? I want to be clear i absolutely love these movies and these characters but they seem to constantly go \"lone wolf\" and put themselves or their mission in danger when it is completely unnecessary. Even if it meant waiting to resolve the situation until help could arrive to ensure the best possible outcome  For example in Spiderman- No Way Home, Peter Parker struggles tremendously against the villains in that film and it costs him his aunt may and nearly MJ. He did at one point have the help of Dr. Strange but in fairness they had a disagreement on the proper resolution to the situation so i will allow that. Why didn't Peter make a phone call or send an Avengers SOS to Sam Wilson, Hulk, Hawkeye, Antman or any of the thousands of people that showed up in the Endgame battle? He did have the help of the other spidermen but at that point he had already lost his aunt. In Endgame we see that the heroes were able to regroup and rally into a large fighting force really quickly if the situation demands it. The multiverse was literally tearing itself apart. In Falcon and the Winter soldier we see that  Sam as the new Captain America had a pretty good handle on the situation but why not call Spider-man or Hulk for back up just in case? He clearly had to travel the long distance from Louisiana to New York, why not make a quick phone call to ask Avengers that might be nearby for help if they are available? If it meant saving more lives why not? Sam and Bucky are both military veterans and should know better than anyone the value of having a solid team and backup in any situation, regardless of how good of a handle you think you have on the situation.  Secondly, why dont the Avengers share technology and resources. We see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier that Sam is in dire financial straits due to the Avengers not actually paying him. Why is this? Even as an informal group why wouldn't Tony fund the group with paychecks and equipment? We see in Age of Ultron that he reformatted Stark tower into a makeshift base of operations. Why not make the Avengers unofficial stark employees so they could be compensated for their time? Peter seems to be the only one that received some manner of compensation in the form of a scholarship and a suit.  With regard to equipment i dont understand why Tony didn't give everyone a mini upgrade to their equipment. Spiderman receives an excellent nanotech suit but why didn't he give Captain America a suit that gives him a strength or speed boost? Hawkeye and Black Widow are incredibly skilled but a basic set of nanotech body armor, even without any bells and whistles would keep them much safer and maybe add a few additional tricks into their arsenal. I dont see why they would turn it down out of \"personal preference\" if it meant it an emergency situation that it might mean the difference between life and death for civilians or themselves. Quicksilver might've been saved incredibly easily if he was wearing a pretty basic Stark tech level set of body armor. Or Hawkeye could've saved himself if he had that shield generator that stark used in Endgame.  &#x200B;  For clarification im not saying the full might of the Avengers was necessary for every mugger and car crash. But for the big stuff... why dont they ask each other for help?\n\nAssistant:",

I mean, what really pushed anakin to the dark was the lack of being able to tell anyone about his true problems, and he more or less did function in a gray manner, utilizing both the dark and light, but only for good during tcw, would he have prospered under an order that allowed him more freedom?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In modern continuity the thing with the Dark Side is that it is a seductive force. The Dark Side in lore isn't like the Dark Side in video games, it's not just \"Red ability bad\" you can use the force in any number of ways it's **how** you use it that determines if its giving in to the dark side. What dictates whether throwing out your hand results in a Force Push or a blast of Force Lightning is more than just intent. It's not enough to WANT Force Lightning, you have to have the aggression to manifest it. The raw, living rage to turn the live energy of the universe into a manifestation of your own anger and desire to harm another being.   The more you use the force for negative actions the more tempted you will be to continue to do so. It's like a narcotic, you can't switch it on and off, its the living embodiment of \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"  One of the downsides of learning to use the Force is that you are committing to living a life of resisting the urge to use the force in negative ways. That's part of why the Jedi have age limits for training. The older you get, the more your personality and mentality have been molded, and the more difficult it is to mold you into the kind of person suited for a Jedi's life style. Anakin had the absolute worst temperament for a Jedi, but thats not his only problem, his biggest problem is one that Qui-Gon Jinn wouldn't be able to solve without going Dark himself.     Anakin Skywalker is a slave boy who was confined and restricted all through childhood.  He gets freed by a Jedi, and is then taken to a new place where he  was confined and restricted. When he gets there he's exposed to a manipulator who quietly tells him, at every opportunity, how awful it was that he's confined and restricted.      You want Anakin Skywalker to remain a jedi? You don't need to keep Qui-Gon Jinn, you need to get *rid* of Sheev Palpatine.      To see why I say this consider Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's own padawan. She was raised within the temple as a child. She was taught patience, restraint, humility, and all that other jazz by a great Jedi mentor while she was a youngling. She's then introduced to Anakin Skywalker, The Chosen One, Hero for the Clone Wars, and although he is impetuous, disobedient, and someotimes downright violent, she emerges from his training honed into the sort of force user most Jedi could only dream of being. She's trained by Anakin, encouraged in all her impulsive feelings and gut instincts, but instead of falling the way he does, she ends up becoming more like Qui-Gon Jinn than he could ever hope to be.  This shows that it's not purely Anakin's personality that's a problem, because he imbues it into Ahsoka and she surpasses her master in her dedication to the tenants of peace and harmony with the Force and the universe.  Anakin Skywalker's greatest problem didn't lie within himself, but with the company he kept.   &#x200B;  Maybe Qui-Gon could have been the father figure he needed, and could have persuaded him to stay away from Palpatine, but that seems unlikely. Palpatine was a master of manipulation. He wanted Anakin Skywalker, he would do whatever it took to get him. The only real way to save Anakin would be to remove Palpatine from the equation."

    "golden_answer": " The appeal of the show comes from the genuine nature of Truman's personality and actions. Everything he does is pure and honest and true; he doesn't know he's on TV and he's not doing it for a laugh or reaction.  Like Christof explains before each episode, audiences have grown tired of special effects and phony emotions. They're so tired of this pretense and deception that watching Truman's earnestly lived life is a greatly appealing alternative, even in its 30th season. The circumstances and situations Truman finds himself in are manufactured, yes, but Truman's reactions and choices are 100% genuine and, sometimes, even a little unpredictable.  Truman also lives a middle class lifestyle like most of his audience. The struggles he faces in his life are relatable and it comforts people to see someone have the same problems they're having.  After running for so many years, I have to believe that a lot of people are attached to Truman like he's an old friend. Even if they don't watch every day, they probably check in to see how he's doing. The show helps to create some consistency in what can be a busy and confusing world."

    "golden_answer": " Likely not much would change.    Certainly, one of the reasons Yoda did not take a more active role in fighting the Empire after Luke's arrival was that he was old, frail, sick, and near the end of his life.  On the surface, then, it seems plausible that if Yoda had been younger and more physically spry, he could accompany Luke off the planet and take a more active role in upcoming events.    Remember, however, that Yoda picked Dagobah as his hiding place because Dagobah was infused with the Force, for example the cave where Luke had his vision was filled with Dark Side energy.  This would mask his own presence in the Force, which allowed him to remain undetected for nearly two decades.  Because Yoda's so strong in the Force, as soon as he left the planet, Yoda's presence would shine like a massive beacon to Force-sensitives, and Sidious would immediately target him.  This wouldn't be helpful to anyone.  Yoda himself knew that he couldn't beat Sidious in a straight-up fight, and drawing the Emperor's attention to Luke and the other rebels would do them no favors either.  So even if Yoda was physically able to contribute to the fight against the Empire, he couldn't leave Dagobah without putting the entire rebellion at risk."

Kingdom seems decentralized to the point where its King is more like ruler of King's Landing\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I mean, you have kind of just identified one of the major reasons why the Iron Throne is actually a pretty weak authority, compared to, say, the kings of England during the high and late Middle Ages.   Westeros was not unified for thousands of years. Aegon unified it with his dragons. For a century and a half lords were kept in line because if they rebelled they’d be burnt by dragons (of course some did try). The main threat to Targaryen rule after Maegor was the chance of Targaryen civil war.   The death of the dragons meant that the kings and queens of Westeros would instead have to rely more on the image of power and authority combined with their personal leadership skills to keep the 7 kingdoms united. If a lord rebels the king could no longer burn him with dragons, but would instead have to rely on other lords to put the rebel down. Greyjoys rebelling? Call up your friends, like the Starks. The Crownlands themselves can furnish some forces, though not many, and the Baratheons also can call upon their own men once they take the throne.   At the start of ASOIAF the King is a Baratheon, his wife is a Lannister, and the hand is an Arryn. Additionally the King has close personal ties to the Starks and Tullies. This web of relationships makes for a formidable alliance, at least on paper (obviously we know that things are less rosy behind the scenes). Even as things fall apart the Iron Throne is still respected enough that it’s worth fighting over. It’s powerful because enough men believe it to be powerful. That may change, however. Constant civil war may cause Westeros to return to its pre-Targaryen state."

Always bothered me, since the machines are portrayed as highly competent both in and out of combat, but Skynet’s strategic decisions baffle me.   1: Radiological weapons would be an easy win. A mild radioactivity won’t immediately kill humans, but you can easily and irreversibly render their territory uninhabitable in the long term. And it poses no danger to Skynet.   2: Don’t manufacture weapons that the Resistance can use to kill you. You don’t need a plasma rifle to kill a human in 20th century body armor. That’s overkill. Plasma rifles, on the other hand, are great at killing armor plated robots.   An argument could be made that they’re useful for killing rogue Terminators, but this quickly falls apart, when you consider that the availability of handheld armor piercing weapons also makes the rogues more dangerous.   I would even go so far as to suggest they specifically design weapons and ammunition which will be extremely ineffective against machines, if captured and repurposed by the Resistance. Brass jacketed soft tip cartridges would suffice perfectly well for killing soft targets, while doing little to no damage against a Terminator.

    "golden_answer": " To understand his reaction, I think we should first understand why he took the actions he did to begin with.  **Thanos does not care about saving the universe.**  He says that he does. He is a liar. He lies to everyone else, and he lies to himself. Thanos cares about saving Titan, which is impossible to do now because he already failed them; so rather than face his failure, he outruns it by telling himself that his ridiculous plan to randomly kill half of them would have made a difference. It would not have. Titan was doomed.  This lie, however, becomes all that Thanos is. It is the driving force behind every action he has taken since, and his entire mad quest to \"save the universe\" is ultimately his last desperate measure to keep this lie alive and keep himself from unravelling. He takes the stakes higher and higher to ensure that there is no going back, and to permanently seal that \"what if I was actually just powerless to save my people\" door in his mind.  If he cared about the actual results of his ridiculous plan, he wouldn't have fucked off to Planet Farmville to hide in a hut afterwards. He would have stuck around to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He doesn't, because he cannot risk being confronted with the reality that he was wrong. It would undo his entire quest to remain the hero of Titan and the savior of everyone. It would kill the lie he has been feeding all this time. Hiding on the farm planet protects him from what I ultimately believe he already knows on a subconscious level; his plan sucks and nobody is going to be grateful.  To get back to your question, we already saw his reaction when 2014 Thanos is confronted with the same realization in Endgame. He completely unraveled because his lie was exposed, and it turned him into a raging, petulant child who was willing to destroy the entire universe just to put his broken lie and his shattered ego back together again. No more calculated mathematical plan, no more strategy; just *fuck this shit*, and he would have undone all of creation to save himself from the truth you're talking about. This was information that Thanos could not afford to know, and it completed up-ended him. He couldn't handle it.

Fleets were expensive and many ships were required to fully surround a planet.  The Death Star was capable of punching through planetary shields in one shot. No lengthy siege needed.

    "golden_answer": " It wold be the space born equivalent of scuttling a ship.  From wiki:  >Scuttling is the act of deliberately sinking a ship by allowing water to flow into the hull. This can be achieved in several ways—valves or hatches can be opened to the sea, or holes may be ripped into the hull with brute force or with explosives. Scuttling may be performed to dispose of an abandoned, old, or captured vessel; to prevent the vessel from becoming a navigation hazard; as an act of self-destruction to prevent the ship from being captured by an enemy force  In relation to a specific Sci-Fi universe, in Star Trek a Galaxy class has a few methods of implementing self destruct.  Primarily, self-destruct was deliberately letting the safeties go on the M/AM reactor and fusion reactors.  Secondary, in case the engines were off line already, was explosive charges in key places (including the anti-matter containment pods). These methods would be used in similar situations that a wet-navy ship would scuttle (mostly to prevent capture)."

    "golden_answer": " It honestly depends which cosmic iteration of Peter Parker we're talking about.  For instance, Earth-616's version of Parker seems to sort of chronally reset every so often, but he is, in essence, performing elder care as well as completing a college degree, then (later) holding down a job as a freelance photographer, and (on top of this) being Spider Man.  Any thoughts of being an entrepreneur or even attending a school further away than ESU would have to take a back-burner to his responsibilities.   (If, for example, he somehow got a full-ride scholarship from MIT, he would not be able to hold down his responsibilities to his Aunt May and also handle any ongoing issues with his seemingly tireless rogues' gallery *and* go to Cambridge, MA.)  In this case, his main source of income is trying to (as benignly as possible) monetize his career as Spider-Man. In a very indirect way, by simply getting better pictures that people would try to get anyway.   It's simply a matter of not being able to clear his schedule to do the things he'd have to do.  Prior to the incident with Dr Octavius, Parker did try his hand at teaching science in the New York public school system. (He seems to be against the idea of picking a lucrative career. ;) ). While... controlled by Dr Octavius, he did set up a business that, now that he's feeling himself again, he is somewhat, tempermentally, unsuited to *run*. This will be an interesting challenge.   Earth-1610's Peter Parker, unfortunately, had a different set of problems. He was, almost immediately, included in Nick Fury's Ultimates plan, and thus pretty much didn't get to pursue his own interests. This timeline's May Parker was *much* healthier and more robust, but all the same he never got to go out on his own."

    "golden_answer": " The Wizard of the Rock of Eternity was originally known as the Champion, and protected the world personally with the powers of six (maybe seven?) gods from a civilization that is no longer known. However, in time he grew too old to continue, and used his magic to command mythical figures to fight for him. Because his name was Shazamo (pfffft AHAHAHA), he decided to choose immortal heroes whose names spelled out his own.   However, the O immortal, Oggar, wound up turning evil, so Shazamo cast him out, erased knowledge of him from existence, and even changed his own name to Shazam in defiance.  In time he realized he could do even more good if he granted all the heroes' powers to one singular Champion. By this time he'd *apparently* traded out his original batch for other immortals from a more recent civilization (Egypt). So he created Black Adam (this ended badly too. The Wizard is basically second only to the Guardians of Oa for screwing things up a long time ago).   Eventually, after the shame of creating Black Adam wore off, the Wizard chose another six immortals (Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury) and waited for a worthy champion to receive their powers. That was Billy. Later on he gave Billy's sister Mary a whole other suite of powers from another batch of immortals: Selene, Hippolyta, Ariadne, Zephyr, Aurora, and Minerva. Mary has also drawn from the same deities as Black Adam, but only after she turned evil and joined his side, implying that the divine powers at their disposal are limited by who they're aligned with.   \\*\\*\\*   Now, most of this is probably void as of the New 52, as our Wizard Shazamo has changed to an elderly Aboriginal shaman named Mamaragan.   Additionally, in very recent stories Billy has lost access to his original suite of powers and instead got a new batch from gods unique to the DC universe, mostly the New Gods. I'm not sure how that worked out. Sorry."

    "golden_answer": " The Avengers meet people who want to murder them on a regular basis. So do the X-Men.  A difference is the kinds of enemies they attract, the kinds of problems they focus on and the resulting public perception.     Yes, there is a minority with hard-core anti-mutant sensibilities, and they're able to leverage many people's baseline xenophobia and other fears to get action or at least frightened non-interference from a large group of the population.  Some of these people are highly placed in government, or are able to exploit people in high positions - such as Senator Robert Kelly's willingness to hype up anti-mutant fears for political gain, rather than any deeply-held beliefs of his own.  Then there are mutants, like Sebastian Shaw and Magneto, who have deliberately created human-mutant conflicts to serve their own ambitions.    Add to this that Charles Xavier founded the X-Men specifically to deal with problems mutants face and thus acted to put his X-Men directly into conflict with the minority of people who have hard-core anti-mutant sensibilities - either by sending them out to confront such people, or by making the X-Men a symbol that such people would preferentially strike at.    Being such a lightning rod was arguably part of Xavier's plans, as a well-trained team of superheroes are a much harder target than, say, a teenager whose puberty experience includes discovering he can make pretty holographic sculptures.    Take a look at Dr. Hank McCoy (the Beast) and his very different experiences as a founding member of the X-Men and as an Avenger.  While serving as an X-Man he spent most of his time dealing with mutant issues and anti-mutant threats, while serving as an Avenger he mainly dealt with Avenger's standards such as world conquerors and threats to reality."

Also, their droids are incredibly inaccurate for robots that have a built in aiming system.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The Separatists are feared for several reasons:  The Republic can't give them a knock-out punch, they keep hanging on battle after battle. People are afraid of any rogue army that takes wild chances, will kill off tens of thousands of troops for no reason, and will brutalize anyone who resists. And the Separatists will always recover after every battle because they can just build more droids. And yet people see their Jedi protectors get fewer and fewer...and Grievous and Dooku are hella scary on their own.      In more detail:      First of all you have to realize Palpatine was not running a conventional war. He was both sides. If one side won, Palpatine *lost*.  Palpatine's goal was to prolong the war (and destabilize the republic enough to gain control) and kill Jedi. Once Palpatine achieved both goals (emergency powers + Order 66) the war was over and it was down to mopping things up. So Grievous had to keep the war burning and kill Jedi and he was great at both.     Who doesn't matter: The clones take time to replace but are essentially irrelevant to the war effort. They are team Palpatine either way so killing them is kind of irrelevant to Palpatine. (and Grievous, whether he knew it or not)      Jedi are who Palpatine *hates.* They stand in the way of his success and he can't fight them all and he could never train enough apprentices to tackle them head-on. Every single Jedi who lives is a big threat to his plans and his personal safety. Luckily there is a very, *very* limited number of Jedi. Force-users are one in a billion, require a lifetime to train to make them effective, have to be constantly retrained to prevent dark-side drift, and each one is essentially irreplaceable. Palpatine will never train enough apprentices to tackle the Jedi head-on. The only way to fight them is to divide them, stoke their inner conflicts, put innocent lives in danger so they take stupid risks, and focus so many blaster bolts at them that they cannot deflect them all and attrition wears them away.      The Separatists (who noticeably have a lot of business/industrial interests) are a custom designed foil for the Jedi with their nearly infinite number of droids. Droids are cheap, suicidally brave even against space-wizards with laser-swords, can be made nearly anywhere on an assembly line, and can fire a blaster. General Grievous can lose a ten-thousand cheap droids and retreat in a battle but along the way if he nails even *one* Jedi than he's doing great! And Palpatine would think that battle was great trade! In this way Grievous could lose every single battle, still remain in the fight and then *win* by steadily thinning out the Jedi.      During any of prequels or associated media do you ever hear about Palpatine complaining \"Grievous you've killed a Jedi but all those droids cost money buddy. We've got a budget you know.\" Nope. Let it rain (droids), nobody cares! As mentioned Palpatine orchestrated the war for those two simple reasons: Cause turmoil with a prolonged conflict so he could seize power, and kill all dem Jedi.

I understand that Skynet caused the initial nuclear weapon strikes that caused the whole world to go to war but how did Skynet continue to take over the world thereafter? Machines at the time of Judgement Day do not have the ability to manipulate the environment designed for humans.  For example, a car may be reprogrammed to run over people but there is no way for the machines to connect the gas station fuel pump to the car's fuel tank when the car eventually runs out of fuel because that requires someone with hands to grab the fuel hose and connect it to the car. Most factories are heavily dependent on humans to assemble items. A computer that wants to kill me could turn off my utilities or give me false information that makes me make bad decisions (such as green light on all sides of an intersection causing traffic collisions) but it cannot walk into my house to actually kill me.

People can’t tell the difference between Superman and Clark Kent and all he needs is a super suit or a pair of glasses. Why do some heroes wear their name on their sleeve and others do not? Hasn’t spidey had to fight off another heroe’s villain a few times?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There are three primary reasons why superheroes adopt an alias/secret identity in the first place:  * So they can maintain a civilian life without constantly being hounded by supervillains or fans; * So they can protect their family and loved ones from vengeful enemies; * So they can protect themselves from the law, as vigilantism is quite often a crime in and of itself (especially when enforced via the methods employed by most superheroes) and their actions would normally make them quite liable for collateral damages and such.  Not having a super hero identity is the exception rather than the rule, so let's look at a few prominent cases:  * MCU Tony Stark - Ego. Pure ego. This explicitly puts him and his companions in danger which he later comes to regret and is motivation for a lot of his future ideas and upgrades. But at the time he \"came out\" it was basically narcisissm. * MCU Thor - Thor lives on Asgard and his human friends are mostly superheroes. Those that aren't are offered protection by SHIELD when a Thor-related threat arises. So there simply isn't a need for him to adopt a secret identity. * MCU Captain America - has no friends and family of note that aren't super heroes themselves that need special protection. * MCU Black Widow - Black Widow is basically *only* a \"secret\" identity. She has no public persona that would need hiding or protection. * Fantastic Four - Since the entire family and friends circle was made superhuman, there was simply no need to adopt secret identities for protection. They are sufficiently rich and powerful that they can distance themselves from the public without being needlessly harassed and generally deal in things at such a high level that legal entanglements are rare and they can afford lawyers to deal with the odd ones that crop up."

Dr. Manhattan is an interesting character in that he experiences all his life at the same time.

When the Comedian is killed at the start of the comic, Rorschach goes to Dr. M first, hoping for information if the killer is unmasked in the future.  But Dr. M can't see the future because of a *cloud* of particles he assumes to be the result of an approaching nuclear war between the NATO and Russia.  In reality, the particles are being generated by Ozy in the future and travelling backwards through time to distort Dr. M's temporal omnipresence - a massive scheme by Ozy to blind Dr. M.  But if Ozy hadn't used tachyons, how would that have all worked?  Would Dr. M always know that Ozy was going to betray him and try to kill millions of people? Even when they were crime fighting together?  Would the comic be over in two seconds if Dr. M could just look into the future and say \"The killer is Ozymandias\" and they go over and beat his ass?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " (Please note, it's been a while since I've read the comic or seen the movie. I'm more familiar with the graphic novel, and I'm not sure which lines from the comic were carried over to the movie or not.)  It's extremely hard to say what would have happened. I don't think Dr. Manhattan would have intervened, though.   At that point, Dr. Manhattan is so far detached from humanity that he hardly cares about it. It's why he walks around naked most of the time. It's only after a long conversation with Laurie that he agrees to return to Earth from Mars.  Furthermore, Manhattan's view of the future isn't so simple. His words imply that the future is already set in motion, and that what will happen is going to happen, no matter what. He says that >There is no future. There is no past. Do you see? Time is simultaneous, an intricately structured jewel that humans insist on viewing one edge at a time, when the whole design is visible in every facet.  He mentions in his conversation with Laurie that \"You're about to tell me that you've been sleeping with Dan.\" Sure enough, a few minutes later, she tells him, and he reacts in surprise. When Laurie is confused by this, saying that he already knew, he replies, \"Everything is preordained. Even my responses.\" He also tells her, “We’re all puppets, Laurie. I’m just a puppet who can see the strings.”  Dr. Manhattan perceives all of time happening at once. You ask, \"Would Dr. M always know that Ozy was going to betray him and try to kill millions of people?\" To Dr. Manhattan's perception, Ozymandias has already done it. So, the question is not, \"*Will* he stop Ozymanias?\" but rather, \"Has he *already* stopped him?\" And I think that Manhattan's detachment from humanity and line about how \"Nothing ever ends\" means that no, he hasn't. From Manhattan's universal view, whether or not a few million or even billion humans die is utterly insignificant to a being who can see the entire length of time at once and instantly be anywhere in the universe. To him, the events of Watchmen have already happened, or are happening now. There's no changing anything, just a set course of events through time."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [Star Wars] Is it possible that the reason for Owen and Beru becoming charred skeletons wasn't flame throwers, thermal detonators, disintegrators or another maybe unknown weapon from the imperial armory but simply blaster fire from more than one Stormtrooper? Considering that the attack on the homestead was meant to look like being the work of the Tusken, who neither own nor use flamethrowers and especially not disintegrators, and we don't see both kind of weapons in the Sandtroopers arsenal for this mission, the most likely weapon that caused the condition of Owen and Beru's corpses are blasters.  Blasters were shown to be able to turn people into charred corpses a short time later in ANH, when we see Han shoot Greedo in the Mos Eisley cantina. Perhaps another reason for this scene, beside giving him a reason to travel with Obi Wan and Luke to Alderaan.  And why would Sandtroopers, trying to imitate a Tusken raid, give their victims a funeral? We never seen or heard about them doing this anywhere.   And simply burning along with the homestead also doesn't make sense, because the corpses lay outside and not in one of the destroyed rooms of the moisture farm.  And people often forget that George hadn't the idea of stormtroopes using thermal detonators, flamethrowers or disintegrators when he made ANH or at least didn't introduced them at this point.

So is it possible that highly powered blaster fire from more than one Stormtrooper could turn Owen and Beru Lars into charred skeletons?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yeah, I don’t see why not. Maybe there was a brief firefight when Owen pulled out a holdout blaster.

Even if you where to attribute the take down of shield and the helicarriers to Cap it wasn’t made public knowledge (I don’t think) and that wasn’t a world ending threat like the ones Tony saved.   Plus the events of civil war have him branded as a traitor to the country and a fugitive abroad.   Even if it wasn’t to honor Steve Rodgers, the captain America image was partially tarnished as seen in falcon and winter soldier show.   So what was the actual reason to put a cap shield on the statue (which is pretty disrespectful to the actual statue by the way)?  Not to be too salty but the only reason I can think of is Cap fandom.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " You're not grasping the power of rugged American individualism as mythos in the culture and the role of its direct symbolism/iconography/propaganda throughout U.S. history.  Mythic American individualism is represented by the morally righteous underdog who persevered through hardship, pulled themselves up \"by their bootstraps\" and conquered their foes with a superiority of might and sinless self-reliance.  Steve Rogers is the All-American Everyman. He's just a kid from Brooklyn with a heart of gold. That appeals to us Americans and our idea of what America represents much more than a wise-ass billionaire, even if that is more in-line with the modern American ideal.  It doesn't really matter what Tony Stark did, he simply doesn't fit the American mythos as well as Steve. We Americans love to choose a singular hero figure to represent our ideals, so naturally Captain America was gonna be our poster boy. The Statue of Liberty is deeply tied to this old-school identity politics and the mythology around it.  That statue was given to the U.S. by France, another country that has historical ties to freedom/liberty and individualistic idealism. Obviously there are lots of differences in how that played out between France and the U.S. over the last couple hundred years, but Cap is the obvious hero to represent that connection and ideology.  In Captain America: Civil War, Tony Stark wanted to sign the Sokovia Accords to keep the Avengers/metahumans/heroes accountable, overseen and controlled. Cap represented the other side of the coin, that felt those in power would hinder, twist and corrupt the heroes who had the power and freedom to make a difference.   Also, Cap's whole thing is American iconography. the red white and blue outfit. The shield with the star and stripes, the whole \"No, YOU move\" mentality, etc."

    "golden_answer": " Like other people said, it’s mostly so they could be accepted.  Powers or physical mutations are not common and viewed as freaks and outsiders. Yes, some of them may pass as normal looking, but the vary in control.   For example, psychic, especially when learning how to control their powers If they have no guidance are constantly tormented with the thoughts of every single person around them, even if they’re not within the vicinity of them. Imagine trying to go to sleep, but you can hear all your neighbors talking in their head or see inside their dreams as you’re trying to sleep or go about your day, like normal?   A close example I can give you in the real world is imagine of every single day you heard nonstop ringing or sound inside your ear? This is the sound that people have when they have either tinnitus or damage hearing. You hear that nonstop, never ending sound, and you’re never at peace, now imagine how it would be if you could hear the TOUGHTS and FEEL their feelings?   constantly...  It’s cool that a person may have the mutation to physically be able to fly like Angel of the X-Men, he always has the hide his wings to blend in. Sure, he may be able to go out and fly the sky and relax, but when he’s down to Earth, he has the hide his physical appearance to not just scare people but prevent attacks because some hate mutants. Some might see him as demonic, and others might see him as a real life angelic being. He can't just go shirtless, hit the beach, gym and participate in every normal events than that a lot of us take for granted. Imagine getting the newspaper for your dad, but you can't walk outside because your wings are visible?   Keep in mind that the same stuff happens with super strength.   They might accidentally destroy a door by just trying to open it because they have no fine control or they may physically hurt somebody by getting in a minor scuffle for fistfight, even something basic like wrestling you might slam the person so hard that it could break all their bones. This is just one of many examples. Sure eventually with time you learn to control it but it’s not that simple. You could easily cause a ton of damage while in the learning phase.  You even saw it in Superman, he has such super strength that he was walking or felt like he was walking in a paper world. He holds back against everybody so much that when he physically fights super human beings, or demigods and gods, he has to 'remember' to let loose.  Keep in mind that these people physically pass as humans to some extent, now imagine if you got a physical mutation like the blob, like some of the morlocks that are physically deformed and with powers ?   Not many of them make it into the Xavier Institute or have a mentor, they go through years of fine-tuning and trying to control their powers. This was briefly touched on in one of the Marvel comics years ago, how some mutants were bitter at the Xavier Institute. When they found out it was a Mutant Academy and that he only took in the most strongest, or the highest potential Mutant. Xavier does use Cerebro to look for mutants, but he doesn’t recruit every single one of them. Sometimes he might miss them or their powers are so tiny, they may not even register.  They are also divided between class in the mutant community morlocks hide in the sewers, because their face is melting, or they give off smoke. Having more visible deformity/with mutation powers. Some useless powers, some that deform them. This made them envious of the normal looking mutants which they called pretty surface dwellers/day walkers, for example like Jean gray or iceman look physically normal. Angel was considered a perfect specimen to them, even though he is a mutant, he was physically attractive, but has the wings of an Angel, never bound to the ground. His mutation was envious due to society viewing him as a divine angelic being, while they would be seen as ugly and deformed monsters."

Jessie has shown herself to be a soft manipulator and social engineer of high caliber, James seems to be able to talk about any wild pokemon into doing anything, Meowth gives them a unique inside track into both tame and wild pokemon behavior, and collectively they can slam together anything from weird vacuum weapons to full on giant robots on short notice. And they do it all while needing to work side jobs and minor heists in order to get the resources to build their gizmos and feed themselves.   And most pressingly *they're mad loyal*. They've been on a scut detail for years of relative time, out of the spotlight and out in the sticks, having to watch other people get better opportunities and promotions while they basically have to live like hobos, and they're still sticking it out. They could go independent (or even go straight) and have a better quality of life than what Team Rocket is giving them, but they don't. They keep their uniforms pressed and keep delivering that whole \"prepare for trouble\" speech with the same resolve they did when they first got roped into that bullshit.   Giovanni wants them to succeed and come home. He wants to put them on other, more pressing tasks. But he needs to be mindful of how the rest of the organization, career criminals who expect failure to be punished, would react. He gave them a task, and as long as that task is still *technically* ongoing, they haven't failed; he can't move them on to better things, but he doesn't have to punish them either. They're stuck in a kind of internal exile, but at least on paper they could win their way out of it and come back in from the cold, and he can provide certain levels of support for their mission without it being questioned."

    "golden_answer": " The superhero Antares, who technically also has (deeply unreliable) super-strength, is someone to look at if you want to know how to get a lot out of flight. She's able to leverage it to scout out battlefields, and greatly improve her striking power in a fight.  Being able to accelerate with no visible cue to is a huge advantage in a fight, every blow she lands hits as though she had a running start because she can use her flight to move as though she had one. Her lunges and feints are literally super human, and in a grapple she's able to push or pull in ways a normal person just cannot.  She's also able to mimic a blaster power because when she accelerates so does anything she's carrying, while she isn't the fastest brick in the air, she's still able to fly at highway speeds, and if she happens to be carrying an actual brick well it's *also* going at highway speeds, and that's going to give anyone pause.  As for stuff you can do *without* risking your precious squishy butt in combat, you can fill the roles of Police helicopters, carry a tranq gun, or a bunch of smoke/stun grenades. You're obviously going to be invaluable in any rescue op where movement is restricted, or when it's hard for helicopters to intervene (trees in the way, crazy winds, etc).  Flight doesn't get exploited very often because it's an extremely common *secondary* power, but make no mistake it is a fantastic power."

  {
    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [Superpowers] What is the most overrated superpower? Me and my friends starting arguing over what is the most overrated superpower after watching some of our favorite superhero and villain movies.    My friend Chuck thinks Superstrength. In his words \"In your day to day life, this really doesn’t matter and will most likely lead to you destroying most of your stuff whenever you get ticked off. Ever bang your desk when upset? You’ll be buying a new desk all the time\". He even quoted Superman “I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard. Always afraid I’ll break something, break someone.”  My other friend Rachel thinks it's Flight. In her words \"This is more of a monkey’s paw scenery but if you wish for “flight” odds are you’ll just be able to fly at the same speed you can run, which wouldn’t be super useful. We’re assuming this is just an isolated power so you’d think it’d be linked to how much natural strength you have. You can only run at a set speed so makes sense you can only fly at that speed too before you get tired and have to slow down. Disregarding that, you could still only fly at around the speed of a car otherwise the wind would be pretty frustrating to deal with. And you will have to bundle up each time or you’ll be freezing. Still useful but I feel most people imagine flying like a plane across a country.  My last friend Mark think's it's Healing Factor due to it only helping you heal which can also slower your aging and will make you outlive all your family members just like Wolverine and be in a deep dark state of depression wondering when and how long you are going to die.   Now for my argument is Super Speed. When you break the sound barrier, the friction of your body hitting the air molecules will produce incredible heat and burn you alive. At high speeds, you may have superhuman reflexes, but now your mind’s reaction speed is going to hold you back. You won’t be capable of responding to a sudden obstacle in your path.   Help us decided who is right or prove us wrong and come up with the real most overrated superpower\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Given that the question is \"overrated\" rather than worst I have to go with strength.  Breaking stuff doesn't seem like a real issue (I can handle an egg without breaking it just fine), but a lot of the cool things people do with superstrength in stories just aren't possible in more grounded physics no matter how strong you are.  Not a bad power per se, just way more limited than it's usually portrayed."

Let me start by saying my knowledge of SW is sparse.  I know very little about the EU outside of the obvious stuff like Kotor and The Mandalorian.   In the mainline movies and shows Jedi are characterized as a peacekeeping police force.  This is ultimately their downfall.   When's the last time Yoda or Mace Windu or the Younglings or someone used the Force to build affordable housing or heal the poor?  I get they stay out of politics so actually running for public office is a bit iffy, but what about also acting as council to elected officials when deciding policy?

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: [MCU] So what are the universe's thoughts on Earth after the events of Endgame? (ENDGAME SPOILERS) For much of the history of the MCU, Earth was seen as a backwater with little relevance or respect within the cosmic community.   The Kree called Earth \"a real shithole\".  The Asgardians had a fairly low opinion of Earth and humanity. Odin said that humans \"do not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table\". Thor called humans \"petty and tiny\".  The Other said that humans were expected to be \"cowardly wretches\".  Earth was barely a blip on the radar of major universal forces, generally only being relevant when it happened to be the site of *other* races conflicting there.  But over the past several years Earth has gradually grown in prominence. They are one of, if not *the*, only planet to successfully fight off an invasion by Thanos' army. According to Fury, after that \"every world knows\" that Earth should not be fucked with. Earth is now the home of the Asgardian race. It is the planet where Thanos himself, the man who single-handedly killed half the universe, fought their forces with the entire might of his army...and lost.  So how is Earth viewed by other cosmic entities like the Kree or the Nova Corps? Is it viewed as nothing more than a backwater that got lucky? Or are they beginning to view it as an up-and-coming major universal force to be reckoned with?\n\nAssistant:",
