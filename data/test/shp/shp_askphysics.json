    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How can black holes grow if nothing passes the event horizon in our frame? Let's say a black hole sucks up a star. Its mass should increase and we see should see the event horizon grow. However if we would look closely not one single atom of the star should cross the event horizon according to time dilation.   So how does that work itself out?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In your perspective, as the infalling object approaches a point on the horizon slower and slower, it carries along with it its gravitational field lines shooting out to infinity. The number of field lines is equal (in some units) to the mass of the object. As it gets closer, these field lines do a very peculiar thing. They shoot sideways from the object, moving parallel to the horizon just above it up to some other point right above the horizon, then they suddenly shoot out radially from there to infinity. In addition the lines distribute themselves uniformly over the horizon: there is a constant number of field lines of the infalling object per unit horizon area. While still emanating from the body outside the BH, the field lines seem to really want to be field lines for the black hole. From afar, it looks just like the black has increased in mass by the mass of the object. If we define as it's natural mass through thennumber of gravitational field lines at infinity, then the BH has by all means grown.  This is actually a piece of a very deep and interesting phenomenon with black holes in which if you purposefully choose \"bad\" coordinates so that infall takes infinite time (as we are doing above) then it's like the black hole \"reenacts\" in some weird codified way the infall using only outside-the-horizon physics. It's eerie."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: why do light atomic nuclei release energy when they fuse and why do heavier atomic nuclei release energy when they fission? &#x200B;  why do light atomic nuclei release energy when they fuse and why do heavier atomic nuclei release energy when they fission?  This graph to explain:  https://imgur.com/9SU7XPA  I know that the amount of energy released during fusion and fission is based on the difference in mass. I also know that the cores at the top of the graph have the highest average binding energy per nuclei. I'm guessing the lighter nuclei need to fuse and heavier need to fission to move up the graph but I don't know why.  My very best guess here is that the nuclear forces' range doesn't reach the outer parts of the nuclei so their average binding energy is a bit lower, and the reason light nuclei release less is because the radius of the nuclear force isn't completely filled yet. but I don't think this answers the question even if it is correct which I'm not even sure of.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The effect is because the strong nuclear force is very short range, compared to the electrostatic force.  The electrostatic force follows an inverse-square law and makes all the protons in a nucleus repel each other quite strongly.  The nuclear binding force between nucleons is a van-der-Waals type perturbation force and varies as a high inverse power of radius, times a decaying exponential in radius.    For small nuclei (think helium or beryllium) the electrostatic force is totally overwhelmed by the strong force.  As you add more protons to the nucleus, it becomes larger and the repulsive force on each new proton is proportionally more important than it was for the last one.  That effect shifts the balance of neutrons and protons for optimal binding:  the strong force works best with equal numbers of protons and neutrons (think helium) but the protons repel one another while neutrons don't.    For small nuclei, the two effects (electrostatic and strong nuclear) are pretty close in effect, but the electrostatic repulsion grows faster.  Eventually (at 26 protons, iron) the electrostatic repulsion begins to overwhelm the strong nuclear force, so subsequent protons and neutrons aren't bound as tightly.  That means iron is just about the ideal condition for a nucleus, optimally balancing electrostatics and strong binding.  Anything much lighter can fuse to be more like iron; and anything much heavier can break apart to be more like iron."

If not, how is it possible for the forces to perfectly balance out so often?\n\nAssistant:",

The centrifugal force you mentioned is a fictitious force that appears in a rotating reference frame.

In any case, what do you mean by “perfect” orbit? Circular?

The point with the de Broglie wavelength is that it has to be similar size to the slit (or in general diffraction geometry) dimensions to see interference.

    "golden_answer": " Water, even clean tap water, always has dissolved gases and solids. As a volume of water starts to slowly freeze, the dissolved materials will generally be forced out of the \"ice\" portion and remain in the \"water\" portion, becoming more and more concentrated. If the concentration rises high enough, the dissolved materials eventually come out of solution.  In this case you put a bag of water in the freezer, probably freshly filled so containing lots of dissolved air. It froze from the outside in, so there was no escape path for any dissolved materials. What you see is the concentration of any solids near the centre; and the small trails of bubbles left as the dissolved air came out of solution. If you want ice without bubbles, you need to freeze slowly from the bottom up, allowing the air to escape.  https://engineering.purdue.edu/MSE/aboutus/gotmaterials/Other/yoder.html  As to what exactly the solids are, generally there are some dissolved inorganic minerals in tap water (in fact it tastes rather strange if there aren't). The slight brown colour probably suggests iron compounds, which are very common.

The issue is that our level of technology is not yet advanced enough to produce nuclear fusion with a net power gain. Eg, it costs more electricity than it produces, at least right now. There is very much a race going on though between world governments, venture capital firms, and researchers, to produce the first net power gain from fusion. Every month there is news about it.  To answer your question, the drawback is primarily the cost to develop the technology to research and develop fusion power to the point where it is viable, something we are not even entirely sure is possible, let alone practical.

    "golden_answer": " I love this post lol  Some people in the thread seem to think that it's due to the moisture on the apple slice after you bite, but I don't think a bite would leave a significant amount of moisture, and apples are already pretty moist inside.  I think it's more likely due to a change in the geometry of the apple slices after you've taken a bite. Like I'm imagining you cut the apples into the little normal shaped slices, and grabbing up the peanut butter with a sharp edge of the slice, so it gets in there real good and nabs some sweet sweet peanut butter. It gets in deep because of the sharp edge, it creates more pressure causing the apple to penetrate deep into the peanut butter, so you can scoop it. But after you take a bite, you don't have as much of an edge, so the apple slice doesn't penetrate much into the peanut butter, so it can't get as much of a hold, so it just pushes it around.   If you want to test if it has anything to do with the moisture, and not the geometry like I think, you could try licking, but not biting, an apple slice and then trying to scoop. If it doesn't scoop, it's likely due to moisture. If it scoops just fine it's probably due to there being no edge."

I think this is a common misconception that there's a lot of sitting around thinking for theoretical physics, because we're not actually physically fiddling with experimental equipment and what not.  While, yes, a lot of thought has to go into what we're doing, you're right, we're not all having miraculous break throughs all the time (as much as we like to think we are!)  As for the day to day, it really depends on what area of physics you work in. One way it can work, is that someone will do an experiment, and there'll be some unexpected thing happening, or a result they can't explain. Along comes your friendly neighbourhood theoretical physicist, armed with a bunch of equations that we know *should* describe the system. We can then combine extra effects and try to derive an equation to explain what's being seen in the experiments.  Other times it works slightly differently. Maybe you want to know what parameters are actually useful to look at in an experiment. For example, I work in quantum transport, and one of my jobs is to look at an electron, look at all of the ways that electron in a certain system can interact with that system, and then figure out a model that the experimentalists can use to figure out what the best parameters are for their design.   Other people do a lot more numerical simulations, and their day to day will look a lot more like sitting down at a computer, and coding up ways to visualise physics that we otherwise wouldn't be able to study, or, again, modelling experiments to help test and explore the physics.  Usually a lot of this is combined. You derive an equation, based on what we know, (this is where a lot of the traditional image of physicist at chalk board probably comes in, although we do that for all areas of physics) , you make some approximations (physicists love approximations), so that you can have a version of your equation that you can look at and go \"OK, if I make that number bigger, that number gets smaller, that means that this, this and this happens,\" so it's a quick way to see physical behaviour. Then, you can code up your full version and check to see how closely your approximations match, to make sure they're actually useful/find out where they stop working etc.  I hope that answer wasn't too long winded and was actually helpful! Like I said, it's very subject dependent. This is my experience of theoretical physics so far (final year PhD student), but this might well differ for others!  Edit: some wording for clarity"

I coped with it by assuming that all mass-having components of such a body would pull an object directly toward it causing both the top and bottom of the body to be pulling at an angle to it's center of mass, partly canceling out. This seems to suggest that gravity is stronger the lesser the body's volume. It also seems to suggest that as you get closer to the body, the extremities would pull less strongly causing a small reduction as the angle increases (not enough to overcome the inverse relationship to distance of the equation perhaps).   The equation for the force of gravity only seems to take mass, displacement, and the gravitational constant into account. Wouldn't the shape of the body have a notable impact on it's attractive force at moderately close distances though?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yes and no.  It is true that the exact strength of gravity at a given location depends on the distribution of mass as well as the total amount of it. However large enough masses will always tend toward becoming spherical, because it decreases the total gravitational potential energy of the configuration. For a perfect sphere, the symmetry ensures that no matter where you are in relation to it the gravitational force will point directly toward the center. Nothing is exactly spherical of course, but for most large objects (including the earth)  this is a decent approximation for everyday applications. However geologists can and do map the slight variations of gravity at variations as a method of understanding the composition of the particular area.  Also if you’re far enough away from something, the slight variations due to the objects shape become completely negligible, and it’s perfect acceptable to just model the object as a point mass."

The early inventors of scientific and mathematic concepts usually did so without any apparent delineation from god and philosophy. This trend continues up until the 18th to 19th century or so, (early enlightenment) with big names such as Newton, Galileo, Kepler and the like still mixing religion and philosophy with science.   Today there is a very obvious and stark differentiation that we can all readily point to. However, many great scientists (Einstein being the prime example) have still remarked as having found philosophy to be tremendously useful, perhaps even necessary to know.   For you, has philosophy, the arts, god, or any such subject been at all helpful?\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Does a full refrigerator use more energy than an empty one? Two identical refrigerators set to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  A is empty, B has a 24 pack of canned beer, already chilled to 40 degrees.     Situation 1:  The door is never opened.   My intuition is that they use the same amount of energy. Is that correct?  Situation 2: The door is opened once a day.  My intuition is that fridge B will use less energy.  When you open fridge A, warm air comes in that needs to be chilled.  In fridge B, less warm air enters because of the beer.  Beer has a high specific heat and so holds its chill while the fridge door is open.  Is that correct?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In a simplified textbook world you are right about both situations, above the effect of opening the door is small enough that it's not worth worrying about that.  But in real life, in situation 1 there can be a quite significant difference. That's because the refrigerator's cooling system, the heat pump, cycles on and off controlled by a thermostat.  When there's more thermal mass inside, it will cycle on and off more slowly.  In an idealized model, that wouldn't matter. If it ran 25% of the time, it wouldn't matter whether that was 1 hour out of four hours or one minute out of 4 minutes.  But the actual vapor compression refrigeration cycle relies on maintaining a pressure difference between the condenser and the evaporator.  Each time it turns on, the compressor needs to first build up that pressure difference before much of work the compressor is doing goes into refrigeration.  Then when it turns off, the pressures equalize between the condenser and evaporator, losing the work that was done to build up that pressure difference.  So there's a certain amount of energy wasted for each cycle, and the slower cycling fridge with the higher thermal mass uses less energy over the course of a day.  Note that better refrigerators will have smart* controls that will avoid having it cycle too fast even if there's very little inside.  But in order to prevent the short cycling, they have to allow the temperature inside to swing up and down more than it would if they allowed the fast cycling, and more than it would if the fridge was full.  Having the temperature cycle up and down a lot is worse for keeping food fresh, so even in that case, having more thermal mass inside is beneficial even if its effect on energy savings is reduced.  *By smart I mean a really basic level of well-designed controls, not being connected to the internet or having a color touch panel on the front or anything like that."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What does information mean in the context of physics? Like the black hole information paradox? When I think of information I assume it's like 1's and 0's in computer science. But is this the same as what Stephen Hawking talks about for the black hole paradox? What exactly does it mean for information to be conserved?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " One of the rules of quantum mechanics is that processes are unitary.  What this means is that if you take a state that has a certain amount of uncertainty - a certain \"distance\" from a particular state where every possibility is equally likely - then the movement of that process through time will never take it closer to or further away from that uncertain state, it will always be no more or less similar to the \"I don't really know\" state than it was before.  So for example, if you measure the magnetic moment of an electron, so that you find which way its little bar magnet is pointing, and then let it move, it will slowly evolve through a set of states, each of which is associated with a particular direction, basically moving around like a top, even though you can't see it, the axis will be just as \"certain\".  This kind of certainty is not the same as classical certainty, because even if the magnetic moment of the electron points sideways, you can still represent that as \"50% up, 50% down\", and by measuring it, force it to pick one, and drop it back into the original axis you started with again, so there will always be uncertainty.  Another way to say it is that quantum systems will still give you answers to questions, even if they are bad answers; if someone is going west and you ask them if they are going north or south, the quantum way to answer is to give a 50:50 chance of giving either option.  But if you keep track of how it *should* be moving, given what you know about it's law of motion, and keep checking whether it is at that point, step by step, you can end up getting a given axis almost 100% of the time, subject to some small amounts of environmental disturbance.  This kind of property, that there is some measurement out there that, if it moves in a synchronised way with a state, will produce reliable classical answers, is called \"purity\", and you can think of a pure state as being fully defined by its starting point and some law of motion, like a classical trajectory.  In contrast, a mixed state hides information, usually because there's some other set of degrees of freedom that are relevant that you don't keep track of.  This state, with lower purity, can be considered a little subjective, in that you can always start by defining a state you have in terms of a mixed state, if you aren't totally sure how well you prepared it in its starting point. In other words, instead of an arrow pointing out of the electron showing where north is, you have a kind of sphere around it on which you've painted a fuzzy probability distribution, giving where you mostly think the north is.  Then you can apply the same unitary transformation, which carries forwards that classical probability distribution, that \"blob\" of options, to other positions around the sphere.  You might discover that your state actually has higher purity than you thought, if you prepare it a lot of times, and find that it consistently gives you the same fixed value step by step, whereas a really mixed state might give you something other than 100% probability of appearing where you expect it to be.  But that basically is unitarity; once you have classical uncertainty, the laws of physics will carry that forwards, not making it better or worse, just moving it around, until you do more measurements to resolve it.  The point about black holes is that they seem to still hide information, while also giving you all the energy back.  You chuck something into a black hole, and you never know what happened to it after that point, but meanwhile, the black hole is getting warm, giving out a gentle buzz of particles from its event horizon.  So you're getting something back, but it doesn't seem to be what you put in.  Or to put it another way, when you set up a black hole in a certain state - if we could build a solar-system sized lab - we don't have a theoretical way to assume that we could just guess what it is going to say next and check step after step after step.  It doesn't seem to just have the quantum \"randomness\" of failing to ask the right questions, but has the pure randomness of there being *no* set of measurements you can do that will give you consistent answers 100% of the time, even if you set it up perfectly. It has actual randomness.  That's the thing people are trying to fix, understand how what goes into a black hole controls what it spits out, so that they can see how the history of the black hole is hidden in its event horizon, so that you can go \"yep, photon leaving from that longitude and latitude, next we'll have a muon leaving there...\" at least in principle, even if such an actual detector is impossible."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is our solar system relatively 2-dimensional? Do all the planets actually orbit the sun in a disk-like fashion as shown in most depictions of the solar system? I think it makes sense given how a gravitational well works like a funnel. However, what’s to stop a planet from orbiting at an angle relative to the other planets’ orbits?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yes. The average plane of the planets is called the invariable plane\\*. Of the 8 planets, the most inclined to this plane is Mercury at about 6.3 degrees, which is fairly close to flat for analogy purposes.  There is no law of physics preventing a planet or other body from orbiting at a high angle. Many comets do, as does Pluto, and we have launched missions like Ulysses) to high inclination heliocentric orbits. The reason the planets are flat-ish is because of how they *formed* in the first place.  The solar system formed from a very large molecular cloud that became gravitationally unstable and collapsed (possibly from a nearby supernova shockwave or something). The angular momentum of all the constituent gas and dust particles add up to a **single angular momentum vector**, pointed in some arbitrary direction. For the solar system this was about 63 degrees relative to the Milky Way's galactic plane. The angular momentum had some random nonzero magnitude as well (the cloud having exactly zero angular momentum is technically possible but very very unlikely - you would need a perfect balance of particles spinning in opposite directions).  When the cloud collapsed, angular momentum was conserved (this is a law of physics). Angular momentum = mass\\*velocity\\*distance from center. So as particles fell in towards the center, the distance decreased and the velocity must increase to make up for it. You get a shrinking cloud that starts swirling around faster and faster. As particles collide into each other in this chaotic mess, they exchange momentum. Statistically most momentum is going around the **single angular momentum vector** from earlier. As these particles bump into others, they hold the advantage and slowly more and more particles start getting pushed along in that direction around the overall vector. The cloud is also getting pretty hot at this point from the collisions, causing it to radiate away a lot of the kinetic energy of the particles. This further causes more particles to swirl in the preferred direction; this is a low energy state.  So ultimately you end up with a thin disk swirling around a protostar. Over time this disk coalesces into the planets, and in this disk they remain. The invariable plane is defined to be perpendicular to the same angular momentum vector present from even before the cloud collapsed.  &#x200B;  Animation of the solar system forming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rg9v3J0IiU  \\* This is different from the ecliptic, which is the plane of *Earth's* orbit specifically."

For example, I was recently wondering about the derivations of the formula which calculates the gravitational potential energy between two objects(which I believe is  -GMm/r).   So, how does one prove stuff in physics, how do I train myself to do that, and are there any books or resources I can use to do this.   Also I'm new to physics. Please keep the resources or answers as basic as possible. Maybe only ones that are calc based\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Of course!   Ok, here is the deal. In math, there are things called axioms or postulates. Axioms are statements assumed to be true with no justification.   For example, the Peano axioms are the axioms that form the natural numbers and define what you know to be addition and multiplication.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms  Maybe you find this intuitive, but they are axioms. You can easily create other mathematical systems that have different properties. In fact, mathematicians do this all the time! They can chose any set of axioms they want!   Mathematicians don't prove axioms, they prove statements based on those axioms. You take your basic assumptions (axioms) and you put them together like Lego blocks to make a more complex statement that must be true given the assumptions.  Ok, what's the point? Well, physics is a science, that means that we are slaves to empiricism. We do math, but we can't chose any axiom, we have to chose axioms that seem to mirror the real world.  For example, the basic laws of Newtonian physics can be seen as axioms that creat a system. With these axioms, I can prove statements like projectiles travel in parabolas or Kepler's laws.   However, it turns out those axioms are only approximately correct. So while those proven statements are useful and intuitively understandable, I haven't proven truth about the universe. I've proven truth about a mathematical system that closely resembles the universe in some situations.   And so we discover new axioms/laws from more advanced experiments (e.g. realtivity) and thus can prove new, more accurate statements in that framework.   So the answer is \"yes, we can prove statements using physical laws as they do in math\", but we can never prove that those statements are true in the universe."

Among this crowd, she has positioned herself to be an authority, which she really is not. I find her to be extremely opinionated in a way that does not allow for other opinions to exist, meaning that she sees other opinions as being “unable to accept the truth” (where “the truth” here is really just her opinion). One instance of this is how she hates anything related to naturalness and acts like people who want to use naturalness as a motivation for physics are simply “lost in math” (the literal title for her book), but she conveniently leaves out that naturalness has historically been a very good motivator and has found huge success. She also rails against any future colliders, saying they are a waste of money because no one can guarantee any new discoveries will be made at these higher energies, but this is so antithetical to how science works and human exploration in general, not to mention that if you want to complain about wasted money in society, there are WAY bigger fish to fry (like the inflated military budget for instance, which spends more money in 2 days than the entire LHC cost to build over a decade).

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: If temperature is the movement of small molecules and atoms, is there a way to convert C° to m/s?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Yes, we can for example relate the tempetature to the average speed, and the temperature has to be measured in Kelvin, K. Let's just consider an ideal gas, because that's easiest. There's N particles in the gas, which has a temperature T, measured in kelvin. The gas has internal energy U = f/2*NkT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and f is the number of square degrees of freedom. (This is the equipartition theorem). f is a bit hard to explain, but for air with mostly oxygen and nitrogen f = 5. So U = 5/2 NkT.   Let's say the gas particles have an average mass of m and are moving at an average speed of v. The kinetic energy of N such atoms will be K = 1/2 Nmv^2. If we then assume that all the internal energy of the gas comes from the kinetic energy of the particles, then  K = U  Rearranging this equation a bit gives  v = sqrt(5kT/m)  So the average speed is directly related to the temperature. But there's some subtly issues with this naive derivation, the first being the value of f. So f can kind of intuitively be thought of as the number of ways a molecule can store energy. There's some translational ways of storing enerrgy: kinetic energy, but the molecule can also rotate, for which there's an associated energy. When assuming f = 5 I've assumed the molecules can rotate, but this isn't necessarily true at the given temperature. So for low temperatures f = 3, and the average speed is then instead  v = sqrt(3kT/m)  You can also look up the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution.  Edit: What I've called \"average speed\" here actually corresponds to what's normally called the root mean square speed, but for these purposes it doesn't hugely matter."

Edit end.  First: I'd recommend learning the necessary maths along with the physics. Therefore:  &#x200B;  **1-**  Halliday One + Corresponding Feynman Lectures  Stewart Vol1 (for calculus, real easy book, I'd recommend supplementing this one with another of your choice)  An analytic geometry one (really don't know any English reference, sorry).  &#x200B;  If you start to hate Halliday, there are lot's of other books on this level, such as Tipler and Serway. Also, there are a shitton of calculus books. If Stewart does not suits you, try another one. If you want to go crazy, pick Apostol's.  &#x200B;  **2-**  Hallidays   Two to Four + Feynmans  Stewart Vol 2 (multivariable Calculus, series, vector calculus)  An Linear Algebra  book.  &#x200B;  3- At this point, **maths intensifies**. Most books will cover just enough, but always supplement with a math oriented book like:  Complex Variables - Churchill  Mathematical Physics - Hassani (not Mathematical methods for god sakes)  Mathematics For Physics - Dennery  Geometry, topology, and physics - Nakahara  &#x200B;  Now, into the physics itself:  **Classical Mechanics:** Taylor's book. Can't recommend this enough. Read this, then supplement with Nivaldo Lemos and Goldstein. You should be okay.  &#x200B;  **Electromagnetism:** Griffiths all the way. One of the best books ever written. If you intent to go to grad level, pick Jackson up, but this will hurt. A lot.  &#x200B;  **Structure of the Matter:** (also known as modern physics): Tipler book is okay. There is also \"Brehm & Mullin\" and Eisberg. Highly recommend going thought this section before going into Quantum.  &#x200B;  **Quantum Mechanics:** There are lot's of good QM books. If you liked griffiths EM one, there is also a QM one, although it's too much introductory. Shankar's one is great, and Sakurai is a master piece (until the third chapter. He literally dies after that and the quality drops a little).  &#x200B;  **General Relativity**: Sean Carrol has a nice book on this. There is also Wald's one, but for me, it has the same Jackson feeling. Hurts you in unecessary ways. Also D'Inverno's book is great, it has something like six chapter preparing you before really starting.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  **Well, about your plan:** Halliday + Feyman is a good call for the basics. There's a lot of hate towards Halliday for not doing shit the \"right way\" but you'll eventually learn it when you go to specific books. Mind you, Halliday has a shit ton of exercises, I don't think there's much need of supplementary books only for exercises, but it's your choice. Practice until you feel like you get it then practice some more.  About the math part: It's nice that you have someone teaching you calculus, but I still recommend reading through a text book. 3B1B is great but **it's not even close to being enough**. It's too much introductory, you need to go somewherelse after watching his course (i'm referring to the ones on YT, don't know about any others).  Also, for lot's of stuff you need **a ton of linear algebra**. I did not see you talk about this anywhere.  &#x200B;  **THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:** Have fun. Do not become a calculator, learn what  you're doing all along. DO NOT JUST FOLLOW STEPS, understand those, and this is by far, the most difficult part. Also, some shit is hard. Really hard. Do not be ashamed of stopping reading something if you're not understanding. Get some easier books or subjects first, then go to the one you're having difficulty, but **DO NOT GIVE UP.** Physics hurts you in every possible way, but it's worth it.  &#x200B;  Sincerely: A grad student."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Why does a car moving at twice the speed will cause four times more damage in a car crash? According to (F=ma)  the acceleration should be twice therefore twice the damage?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " \"Damage\" is not a very well-defined word.  The amount of *energy* dissipated will be four times as great.  The amount of *momentum* change will be twice as great.  The amount of *dollars* lost depends more on whether your car has those fancy parking sensors in the bumpers than on the speed."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I'm 23, self-learning Math/Physics - any advice? Hey everyone. I don't use Reddit a whole lot, but the more I get into self-learning, the more I'd love to have people to discuss topics with.  Quick background info: I'm 23, went to a private university for 4 years to get a degree in music education, ended up double majoring in Japanese studies, took too many classes outside both majors and couldn't graduate in time, so I decided to drop out.  I have a lot of interests, most of them in creative fields, so I'm grateful for what I got out of college, and I'm currently pursuing a career as a creative entrepreneur.  Creating and Learning are two primary things in my life that I never want to stop doing. I've always been a self-learner and recently i started spending more time pushing myself to read regularly.  This past month, I read Stephen Hawking's \"A Brief History of Time\" and it was super interesting. I've always had an interest in Physics, but only took one class in high school. I also took AP Calculus in high school, but it wasn't something I was particularly good at (I passed the class with a C+, but didn't pass the AP Exam). Either way, I'd love to have a deeper understanding in Physics and Math, so I'm starting a self-study project.  Obviously, I need to have the foundations down first, before I try to get into anything complicated.  I'm currently going through:  \\- A Stanford course on Coursera by Dr. Keith Delvin called \"Introduction to Mathematical Thinking.\" I just finished up Week 1.  \\- \"The Foundations of Mathematics\" by Ian Stewart and David Tall. I'm finishing up Chapter 2 on Number Systems.  \\- \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics.\" I read Chapter 1 earlier.  \\- I'll probably take the \"Single Variable Calculus\" course on MIT's website after I finish \"Intro to Mathematical Thinking.\"  I have a ton of interests, so I have no idea where this will take me or how deep I'll be able to go, but I'd love some kind of feedback/advice on self-studying Math/Physics - am I picking up good beginner material? Is there a way that I can use this subreddit to further my study? Anything like that would be great - Thanks!\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Just reading and watching vids won't do much. You need to actually do exercises and solve problems over and over and over again.   I'd advice you to only try to learn the very basics for now until your business takes off, so classical mechanics, special relativity, linear algebra, complex and real numbers, and integral and differential calculus. That should keep you busy for a very long time if you're only doing this as a hobby.   Most \"recreational physicists\" immediately want to jump to the juicy parts like astrophysics and cosmology, but I guarantee you that that's gonna be a massive waste of time if you actually want to understand something beyond the very surface."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do we know that gravity should be added to quantum physics? For example I often hear that we need a quantum version of gravity to explain singularities in black holes and like that gravity was the first force to be separated from the other three. But how do we know that if we ever have a quantum model for gravity, we can explain singularities in black holes? Basically my thought is, for example if we haven't reached the energy levels in our colliders where all four forces are merged, how do we know that all forces are indeed one before. Is it indicated in our current understanding of physics that research on these fields are the proper next steps or are we just hoping for the best that our hunch is right or that we stumble upon new physics?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Having a quantum theory of gravity is not the same as unifying all forces. For example, in the Standard Model we have the electroweak and strong interactions, both quantum, but they are not unified. We expect that gravity should have a quantum description because matter produces gravity, and matter is quantum."
