    "golden_answer": " Im part of the brown butter cult!  Weigh the butter before browning it and weigh it again after browning and cooling it down. The difference in weight is the moisture in the butter that evaporated during cooking. Simply add water back until its the same as your starting weight. It called ‚Äúreconstitution‚Äù   I would hand blend it to emulsify the water and brown butter properly. You can refrigerate this and would lasts for 2 weeks, or a month in freezer.

I am planning my mom's birthday cake and would like to make the Smitten Kitchen Red Wine Chocolate cake. I have made it before without frosting. It has a lovely fudgey texture and deep chocolate flavour with a hint of acidity and cinnamon. The wine does actually come through in the final product, which I quite like.  I would like to add a frosting + filling (and maybe fruit topping) this time because I think it makes for a more stunning birthday spectacle, but a bit sure what to pair with it. I don't want to overwhelm the lovely complexity of the cake and also don't want to create something sickly rich since the cake is already quite dense and full flavoured.   The Smitten Kitchen recipe recommends mascarpone frosting, but I can't get mascarpone here üòî. Currently, I am considering a cream cheese frosting or a chocolate buttercream, possibly with raspberries. My roommate suggested cherries as a natural chocolate pairing.  I wanted to ask the Reddit baking experts. Any thoughts on complementing a red wine chocolate cake?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " if you want to go deepest chocolate route, you could use bittersweet chocolate to make a ganache, then pour over and let the sides drip down.  in this case i would fill with strawberry, raspberry, or cherry filling.  just cook the fruit down a bit (simmer out the water) with some sugar (to taste).  squeeze of lemon or pinch of citric acid, then thicken with cornstarch.  if you're more interested in going closer to the originial, maybe a cream cheese ermine frosting.   its pretty easy to make mascarpone, if you have time.  i used to do this to make tiramisu for a friend when I lived in a rural place where i couldn't buy it.  this link uses lemon juice, but you can also use any neutral tasting vinegar.  i like white wine vinegar best.  https://www.thepetitecook.com/mascarpone-cheese/"

There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is. I don't \\*think\\* they are merely blowtorching sugar onto the pastry because it's not burnt. I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity). I've also tried rolling the dough in sugar before forming the danish like a kouign amann, which was good but far from their effect.  &#x200B;  Are there other ideas I may be missing?

    "golden_answer": " Regardless of recipe, the general technique is the same.   1. Get the butter into the flour 2. Add liquids and get the dough into a \"rough ball\" 3. Roll the dough  In the first step, you want to \"cut\" the butter into the flour so that you have pea-sized balls of butter covered with flour.   One easy way to do that is use a pastry cutter, but if you don't want to do that then one trick a chef taught me was to use a food grater and grate the butter in. Then just mix the flour a bit and you'll have pea sized balls of butter covered with flour.  After that, when you shape the dough into a ball... try to work the dough as little as possible. The more you work it, the more you develop the gluten and you will end up with a mealy dough. Try to press down on the dough to form it since that works it the least.  The whole goal is to keep the butter as cold as possible while you work with it. That means, throw your butter in the freezer for a few minutes before you cut it in. Throw your dough in the fridge for a bit when you've got it into a rough ball. Don't let that butter melt!   Lastly, when rolling out the dough, be gentle. It will eventually roll out. And if you have to stop for a minute and refrigerate it to cool it a bit, that's fine."

My question this time is: if I were to replace the 2 eggs in this recipe,  would I also need to increase the amount of baking soda or even add baking powder?  https://www.canadianliving.com/food/baking-and-desserts/recipe/classic-chocolate-chip-cookies   I read that eggs provide some leavening, but I'm unsure if that applies to cookies, since they do not rise as much as a cake, for example.  If I do have to increase the baking soda, how much per egg should I add?  I was thinking of replacing the eggs with aquafaba; is that a good substitute for this recipe? If not, what do you suggest? I do not care for using flax/chia eggs or applesauce as substitutions.  Thank you very much\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I have a lot of experience converting regular recipes to vegan recipes.  This involves substituting the eggs. I usually use 3 tbsp of Aquafaba (the liquid in a can of chickpeas) in place of one egg!  They work great and can actually be used to whip a vegan meringue too :)  Hope this helps!"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Having a hard time transitioning to stand mixer. I've been baking for a long time and baked most Western lean breads as well a bunch of enriched enriched doughs (French, Italian, Swedish). I'm pretty confident with baking because I've been able to do this all by hand (not a pro).  So when I saw a Kitchenaid stand mixer on sale I figured hey, this'll save me so much time and I'll do volume easy! Wrong. Turns out I can't even do the mere basics of what I was doing before. For e.g. working on an enriched dough, my dough has failed twice and I really don't understand how fast to run it for how long.  For Brian Lagerstrom's pretzel dough I stirred for 3 minutes. Speed 2 till it came together (2 mins) and then started adding butter in tsp. It was a mess so I went hey, let's run it faster to give it strength. Ran it at 4 and it was downhill the whole time. Result was an overkneaded porridge. Ive failed cinnamon rolls, brioche and this pretzel dough and now I'm convinced I don't know how to use this machine and need help. I am yet to experience this \"dough slapping across the bowl\" i see in every youtube video because of this.  The one solution outside of this I'll try is being super anal about butter temp and forgoing AP flour completely. Stick to bread flour since the strength gives my wiley ass a safety net before I get flour porridge again. Also maybe oil the bowl but that's really just desperation from me. I'd love any advice y'all have for me :)\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It sounds like your issues are probably two things: going too fast, and not always using the right attachment.  For the dough hook, you generally don't want to go over 2 on the mixer, or it will get overkneaded. For some enriched and/or high hydration recipes, you will want to use the paddle rather than the dough hook. In those cases, you can sometimes go to a higher speed, though you will want to see what the recipe says. Most recipes will specify where this is okay, but it is uncommon.  As you are learning to use the mixer, I recommend stopping every minute and checking your gluten development to get a sense of where the dough is at and what has changed. To me, this is a much more accurate metric than whether it slaps around the bowl or balls up on the hook - that doesn't always happen.  Lastly, if your doughs are coming out wet - are you adjusting for flour that you would have added when kneading by hand? You may have been adding a good bit of flour over the course of the process, that isn't getting added since it is all in the mixer. So you might need to add a few tbsps or more additional flour."

Room temp Unsalted butter  Turbinado sugar (probably shoulda used white sugar?)  Cold Eggs (weighed the liquid after discarding shells. Came out to 9 eggs.)  I creamed the butter and sugar, and beat the everliving heck out of some eggs, folded the eggs in but the turbinado sugar had the butter bound up too tight so i hit it again with the mixer and it seemed to air up fine even with the eggs... Anyway after that I gently slowly folded in a pound of flour with a sieve to keep out clumps. It baked up well, rose well, took it out when there was no more batter on the stick... Yet here is my rubbery pound cake...   Any help to make the next cake better?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " 225g each of flour, butter and sugar will yield  one good loaf-cake.  AP flour is fine. Self raising (British) has baking powder built in. Self Rising (USA) has baking powder and salt. You can skip all that nonsense and use regular AP with 3tsp of baking powder to every 225g of flour. Done.  Salt \\*can\\* interfere with leavening.  Turbinado sugar is BAD (for this. I love it as a sprinkle on top of muffins and stuff before baking. It's more of a garnish or topping than an ingredient.)  It's probably the bulk of your problem.  Next time use CASTER sugar which in the USA is usually called \"Fine Granulated\"  There's chemistry science behind this that involve what happens when you cream it with the sugar. The whole point of which is to get as much air in it as you can and the grain size of caster allows this to happen best.  If you're using a stand mixer set a timer for \\~5 minutes and use the paddle on med-high. It's done when the butter turns from yellow-ish to white and if you rub it between your fingers,  you don't feel a LOT of grains of sugar. (you'll feel some.) Just getting it all the way pale, if you're using caster is enough.  Eggs should be room temp. If your recipe called for cold, I don't know why. It's wrong. Also, don't beat the eggs first. Have a little bowl where you're working and crack the egg one at  a time  into that (just in case so you don't have to fish shells out of the batter if that happens) and then add it to the batter.  So with the butter and sugar creamed, add 1 egg at a time and let the mixer go for 20-30 seconds in between each egg on medium medium-low speed. you're not really trying to add any air at this point you just want to evenly get the eggs emulsified into the batter.  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the SIFTED flour into the mixture. Be **patient** and gentle. Do. Not. Rush. This. This is a good time to get kids involved. They can hold the sieve and shake the flour into the batter for you while you fold.  I sometimes have cake-batter-hunting children around when I bake.  Line your tins with parchment with tabs that will make lifting the cake out easy and carefully fill the tin. Gently level the top of the batter. Use a spatula or something, don't bang the tin on the counter to settle it b/c that will literally settle-out the air. No need to be fussy about it though, just generally level is fine.   Check out this video with some good advice about technique."

I remember when my mom would bake cookies for my sister and I, she would follow the recipes in the back of the toll house package, but subtract at least half of the sugar.  The cookies were always soft when coming out of the oven but after cooling down, they would get very hard.  So p, you need to add something back in that helps retain moisture.  I found a ground fiber helps, like chia, psyllium, slipper elm etc.   they all will add their own taste and properties so it may take some experimenting.  Also, just because you eliminate half the sugar from a recipe, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can do a 1:1 sugar/fiber swap with any of these fibers.  If you do that, it would honestly be a disaster."

I forgot about the deep dish part though and just prepped dough for a regular 9-inch pie (already lined the pan), so my plan is to use the leftover filling for a smaller pie pan. Unfortunately my parents also happened to buy another pumpkin pie just today, so if I went through with my original plan we'd end up with 3 pumpkin pies over the next couple days.   I'm hoping instead to just make the 9-inch pie, and reserve the excess filling for the smaller pie to bake later. How long can it last in the fridge, or even better could I freeze it?   Since pumpkin pie filling is really a custard, I know in general some custards don't freeze well. I've also read instructions for another pumpkin pie recipe to not store the filling (with eggs added) longer than an hour before baking, as the acidity from the pumpkin puree and brown sugar in the recipe would partially coagulate them. However the recipe I'm following doesn't include brown sugar, so I'm not sure if that would be as much of a concern. For reference, the recipe is: https://www.modernhoney.com/the-best-pumpkin-pie-recipe/\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Many bakeries and restaurants make pumpkin pie filling ahead of time. Like with any custard you can store it in the fridge for a few days. Just allow it to sit at room temp for about an hour to take the chill off before putting in your pie shell and baking it. The PH of pumpkin puree is about 5. I don't think that the pumpkin or  brown sugar are a strong enough acid to \"cook\" and set the proteins in the eggs.   I hope that helps!:)"

However, is it possible to overcream butter + sugar? I always feel so scared of overcreaming that I believe lately I have actually been undercreaming instead.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There are two schools of thought when it comes to creaming butter and sugar. Some people say tou should cream just long enough for the butter and sugar to be well combined. In this school of thought the sugar has started to dissolve into the butter but you won't be able to see the dissolving and the mixture will still be grainy.  The second school of thought is that you should cream butter and sugar until the mixture lightens in color. This approach incorporates more air and results in more airy baked goods.  I personally fall into the first camp, and I call the second school of thought whipping (not creaming). If you use older recipes, they make the same creaming/whipping distinction that I do. But, many modern bloggers default to whipping their butter and calling it creaming.   For cookies (since this is cookie season), extra air in the butter will mean a more cake like cookie. Some people love cake like cookies, and you should definitely cream your butter and sugar until lightened if you want cake like cookies. If you're like me and you want a cookie that's nice and chewy, keep the creaming to a minimum. If you bake cookies for people who want a nice crispy cookie (maybe you're making nice snappy ginger snaps), the creaming should also be kept to a minimum."

The crystalline structure of sugar and the way it supports the structure of the baked food are important contributors to texture. The only thing that comes to my mind is salt, but that would be gross in the necessary quantities. Perhaps, you can think of an alternative.   The other thing that sugar often contributes is caramelization. That brown color that we associate with a cookie being fully baked is, in part, due to the sugar. You may be able to replicate the browning effect by using egg wash, but that wouldn't work for the sides and bottom of a cake or a quick bread."
