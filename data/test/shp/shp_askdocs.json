    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is my dr annoyed at me? Extremely embarrassed Hello  F30, antidepressants and Lexapro, no alcohol or smoking. Duration - 2 years, 5'5 145lbs, caucasian  I recently was at the ER with a migraine, and after being discharged once it was under control (used 4 different medications and a steroid) the Dr said to follow up with my neurologist, sooner than my already scheduled July appt.  The neuro office called and got me in the following week with my neurologist. I was just reading my notes and it reads,   \" Overall she requires a lot of support, with frequent messaging and urgent visits. She requires a lot of involvement from her multidisciplinary team, including mental health and primary care. At this point there remains no neurologic explanation for her symptoms.\"  They are leaning towards it being a Functional Neuro Disorder, but had said to message them with any symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours, so when my unsteadiness  led to multiple falls, I reached out this spring.   I am absolutely devastated and ashamed that they seem to think that I'm a needy patient, or exaggerating. I am just trying to function and do what they asked... Is that the right interpretation?   How can I keep my doctor's respect?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " The fact that he uses the term \"requires\" says a lot. If he felt it was you being needy you would see things like \"unwarranted\", \"repetitive\", \"incessant\", \"unfounded\", etc. He is letting your new doctor know that you are a patient who will require this type of follow through, and to expect calls/messages frequently without them being alarmed."

    "golden_answer": " If a \"family friend doctor\" does this without your permission, it is sexual assault.

That doesn't mean you want to or should try to turn it into a legal battle, but that's the status here.  With your permission, a good lawyer could probably get that recognized as malpractice, because this is not a recognized medical examination, it is not being done for any sound reason, and any harm, including emotional, suffered as a consequence would be harm due to breach of standards of care—in other words, malpractice.  Leaving aside the fact that this exam is meaningless, your mother has no right to demand this or any other exam or any results of any examination you have. You are not a minor and you are entitled to full medical privacy. If you need to do something to calm her down, that's a family issue and not a medical issue.

My first question is whether or not waiting over a year is normal for seeing a hematologist? Should I try a different hospital?

    "golden_answer": " As a carrier (heterozygote -- you have one normal gene and one mutated gene), you are at somewhat increased risk for blood clots, and you also have a 50/50 chance at passing your mutated factor V gene to your kids.  Your risk of having a clot is about 3-8x higher than the general population, but still low overall -- about 1 in 200 people who are Factor V Leiden carriers will have a clotting event in any given year.  You're male (I assume cis male?) so I don't need to tell you about pregnancy and contraceptive risks.  However, if you have daughters or sisters who've also inherited factor V Leiden, they may want to speak with their HCPs about this.  You shouldn't smoke tobacco period, but smoking is also an independent clotting risk factor that won't mix well with your factor V Leiden status.   I'm not aware of any medication you need to be on for your factor V Leiden status if you've never clotted.  The risk of taking anticoagualant medications outweighs the benefits to you right now.

We are still waiting for the autopsy report, but our family is obviously grieving and the uncertainty is killing us. Therefore im turning to you, in order order for, even if it's very little, information. I will do my best in explaining the whole situation. Im also an CRNA and therefore have some medical knowledge.   My nephew was a typical teenager. Just finished high school, didn't have a job yet. Was up all night gaming and sleeping all day. Had alot of friends, was a very kind-hearted person. Had no known medical issues apart from being born pre-mature and having ADD. According to his little sister and some friends, after the incident, he occasionally took Lyrica as recreational drug use, but very certain that there was no other drugs.   The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.   What do you all think? Is there anything im missing or not seeing clearly? Or maybe someone with more expertise?\n\nAssistant:",

On average, she has 1 drink (beer or glass of wine) with dinner with me, once a week. That’s it. She is definitely not addicted to alcohol or going through any withdrawal. No medication either. No family history of seizures or alcohol abuse, or any other medical condition.  She recently had 2 seizures, both times with me.  The first time, she drank 1 glass of wine on an empty stomach. Then after 10 minutes of finishing her drink, she suddenly froze and looked confused for about 2 minutes. She started to pee her pants and didn’t know what happened after she “came back”. We didn’t think it was a seizure because she wasn’t shaking or anything, but now I know that was a seizure because it happened again.  About 2 weeks after that incident, we were having a beer together with sushi. She had drunk about 1/6 a bottle of beer (literally like 3 sips). Then, she started actually shaking and making weird noises while her eyes rolled back— what you’d expect a seizure to look like. I tried to hold her up but she was shaking so violently that we both fell to the ground. It lasted about 45 seconds. She did not pee her pants, but she again didn’t know what happened after.   We went to the doctor but because of COVID-19, we need to wait a couple weeks to run tests. I am wondering if I can get any help or ideas on reddit. Please help, I am very scared. She is not as scared as me because she doesn’t even remember the experience. But I saw and witnessed everything both times and am traumatized. Please help what this could be, and what we should do. Thank you.   More background: -she was on her period the first time, but not the 2nd time -this was the first time seizures ever happened -we haven’t had a single drop of alcohol after the 2nd incident -the only common factor in both seizure incidents was alcohol -she is 165cm (5’5) and 51kg(112lbs) not under or overweight  -no mental illness, no medication, no family history -she is not an alcoholic, nor does she smoke or do any drugs\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I had my first seizure after half a glass of wine. It turned out that my alcohol consumption was completely inconsequential (as I continued to have seizures regardless of whether I was drinking).  My trigger is the relaxation/let down after prolonged periods of stress.   For many, alcohol can lower the threshold and cause or contribute to seizures.    I would recommend seeing a neurologist that specializes in epilepsy. I’ve seen both regular neurologists and epilepsy-focused neurologists and much preferred my care under the epilepsy specialist.  It is worth noting that seizures don’t always mean epilepsy, but it does mean it’s time for a neuro consult.  We welcome both you and your girlfriend at r/epilepsy. — it is a great community for those experiencing seizures, even if it turns out it’s not epilepsy.  BIG IMPORTANT EDIT: your partner should not be driving until the cause of the seizures is determined. It’s been too short of time to actually know if alcohol and hormones are her triggers."

I had my gallbladder removed in June due to frequent vomiting and fatigue, it was full of sludge but no stones. The first week and a half I ate maybe four times, and just about a cup of soup. Otherwise I only ingested pedialyte. After that first week and a half, the vomiting reappeared. Since then, I usually vomit at least once a day, no matter what I eat. I've always been pretty health conscious and eat well. I restricted my diet more, still vomiting. Sometimes I don't eat, and once again, vomiting. It's almost always bright yellow/orange bile, food, or blood. I assume the blood is the stomach acid tearing up my throat. I get dizzy, see what look like shooting stars, and have passed out once.   I have terrible insurance. I'm poor. But I've been able to splurge and see a doctor a couple times. It's always the same answer, \"here's some antinausea\". They don't work. I vomit them back up with bitter bile. I have endometriosis as well, and pediatric onset glaucoma (inherited). I feel like I'm getting weaker, I've lost several pounds recently.

I work 10 hours a day, usually 50 hours a week, and usually this has to be an after work dinner thing (if I move around afterwards I will vomit).  What can I personally do to combat this?

I (25F) have just had a transvaginal scan which revealed I have either uterus didelphys or complete bicornate bicollis uterus (they don’t seem to be sure and I’m not quite sure what either term means).   But essentially they’ve said I have double of my uterus, cervix and vagina, and they said it’s like having a shitty version of the septum in your nose. (Great, sounds lovely, thanks doc).   But anyway, I’ve always wanted to get an IUD, because I heard they can be better for you than the pill and help with bad period pain, etc. I’ve always had longer periods (like 7 days long) with really bad pain - ‘taking full doses of ibuprofen and Panadol and still needing a heat pack’ type pain - and changing between pill brands didn’t help at all. (Oh, and I bled even with tampons in, so I thought I was just really bad at. . . Putting them in, I guess?? I had very bad self-confidence).  So I wanted to get the pain under control and knew the doc could possibly give me pain meds, or even better an IUD, which is part of the reason I went to see the doc in the first place. And, because. . . Well I had always known I was a bit different (I just had like, an extra path. I thought it was a pocket, I think? A surprise, like in a really cool dress?).   I told the doc and she said ‘look, it’s extremely unlikely, you probably have endo’ and sent me for an ultrasound. My mum said ‘you’re an idiot, I’ll buy you a bloody car if you have two vaginas’. I haven’t reminded her about that yet.  So anyway, I’ve been referred to see if I have both my kidneys (apparently sometimes people like me lose them?) and see a gynaecologist who will maybe know how the hell I deal with pregnancy if that ever happens. Or two pregnancies in two uteruses at once, if you’ve really done something to offend some fertility deity.   So in the short term, I’m still in pain, and is there any chance I could get an UID before I try to think about the horror of childbirth(s)? Or do I need two IUD’s?

Respiratory infections can last longer with underlying untreated asthma, but albuterol or another inhaled bronchodilator can help open up your lungs and clear the infection faster."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...\"exits\", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?\n\nAssistant:",

She cries all the time and says “What’s wrong with me!” “I wish this could be taken away.” “Why is my brain doing this to me!?”  It’s absolutely heartbreaking seeing her, especially at such a young age, go through this.  She did start going through puberty early. Starting when she was 7.5 she skyrocketed in height, developed breast and has pubic hair. Though hasnt started her period.

She’s going through a lot of changes and it sounds like you’re trying to be as attentive as possible.   Research says girls that start puberty younger struggle with body image, self esteem, and anxiety more than their male counterparts and girls who have puberty later. “Why is my brain doing this to me” sounds like anxiety. There are many many coping skills that she can learn to help this. Therapy could be a huge help. It’s not just for “crazy people.” Sounds like she just needs a few skills to help her out.   In terms of interacting with her, remind her that she’s safe, you have her covered, and that there is nothing wrong with her. Feelings are not facts. And she’s going to be ok."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Shattered femur 2 months ago in DUI crash. Doctor feels neglectful because of the circumstances. Here's the x-ray that was taken last week. The accident and surgery were on the 15th of June.  https://imgur.com/a/dcZowlj  Two months ago I crashed my car after passing out behind the wheel and not wearing a seat belt. I was going around 45 mph and slammed into a concrete electrical pole. This was a DUI crash and a huge wake-up call for me and the direction my life was going. It's really a case of I shouldn't be alive and I'm grateful to even be here making this post.  It feels like because of my circumstances my doctor doesn't have as much compassion for me as his other patients (I've heard him talking to other patients in the room next to mine at my appointments and his demeanor seems to be much more caring for them.) The appointments have not been more than 5-10 minutes with the doc. My first appointment was 3 weeks after the surgery and his advice to me was \"use crutches and don't fuck it up\".  His words not mine. His assistant had been talking to me earlier and said \"you probably won't need physical therapy\" and no mention about PT from the doc, just \"don't fuck it up. Fast forward a month later to last week, the first thing the doctor and assistant ask is \"how's therapy been\". I didn't even know I was supposed to be going? I told them I hadn't gone but I showed him that I was able to walk and bear weight without crutches but my leg would collapse if I wasn't stiffening out my knee. He then checked my knee and ordered an MRI and said \"yea with these types of injuries its common to injure the knee as well\". I got my MRI done 2 days ago and will be back to see the doc next week with my MRI results. If this is so common, why didn't they check for this earlier?  As far as the femur goes, he told me that it's just about looking healed. How is that possible? I still feel pain when I move my leg in certain ways, mostly in the inside of my thigh where the bone has split. It feels like the end of it is poking the inside of my leg. To me it doesn't look like it has healed much at all to me so that's why I'm here trying to get some second opinions.  I wanted to ask all this with the doctor but he seemed to get visibly annoyed and already on his way out to the next patient.  &#x200B;  Thank you in advance. I'm genuinely worried about my leg being messed up for the rest of my life and not being able to go back to the outdoor activities and sports I loved to do before this.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Agree with other posters advising you to get a second opinion.  However, I'd expect and get used to very little compassion from future caregivers around this issue. Your experience will likely be less negative if you accept this beforehand and lower your expectations. Orthopedic surgeons are often trauma surgeons, and have to deal a decent amount with the victims of drunk driving. Compassion fatigue is a real thing and it's extremely difficult to get emotionally invested the same for someone who was the victim of a DUI as someone who did a DUI who is only not in jail because they got morally lucky."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Was hospice the right decision? I’m (27 f) emotionally going through the ringer here. My mom (61 f) who has been battling stage 4 breast cancer since 2015, was told 4 weeks ago her liver wasn’t responding to the chemo and the tumors were increasingly growing. They quickly changed to a new chemo in hopes that it responds well to the liver tumors- but no luck. The bilirubin numbers were high, starting at 2.1, then 4.9 a a week later, and a 11.2 the following week. I was told there is nothing else we can do. No more chemo, no radiation. Her liver is failing. I asked about clinical trials, liver transplant, and immunotherapy- all which I was told she doesn’t qualify for due to the Mets spread to her bones, lungs and brain as well. She had brain surgery a year ago to remove a tumor and was told she had leptomeningeal disease. But that improved with intrathecal injections + cyber knife radiation.    Hospice was the only option other than taking her home regularly with a home health aide. Which was not enough support in my opinion with her current state. I chose hospice after hearing the recommendation of two oncologists (including her regular oncologist) and 3 ER doctors. I feel guilty for choosing this option. She’s at home and for the past 3 days now she’s been mostly asleep. Barely speaking. I’m so scared. Every time I give her morphine I feel immense guilt. I’m only 27, this is a a lot.

Find support groups for grieving adults.  Take up a small hobby - buy a plant, learn to knit or crochet, or find some YouTube yoga videos.    Try to make videos with mom when she is awake and coherent.  Do not feel bad about giving her scheduled pain medications, or her sleeping.  If she is sleeping, she is comfortable.  Figure out family secrets.  Hold her hand.  Tell her about your day.  Turn on some of her favorite shows on TV.  Brush and style her hair (if she has any after all those treatments).
