    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: America is not land of the free unless you’re either already financially well off, or the small % of people who get rich. Growing up I always thought America was the coolest and wanted to live there (based on American music, TV, movies, etc.) however now I’m older my view has changed a lot and this is no longer the case.  My stance is purely comparing America to my home country (Scotland).  I now believe America is capitalism gone wild, which is great if you’re rich and successful already, but if you’re not it’s a rigged system you’re unlikely to beat.  In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.  Regardless where you’re born (I was born somewhere between lower and middle class), you have the ability to succeed as medical bills or saving for a child’s education won’t bankrupt you, whereas in America that isn’t the case.  Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it’s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.  I believe this is, in part, what lead to the opioid crisis America is currently in.  Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.  Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.  Obviously America is a world super power and leads the way in a lot of things, but I believe as a random person of average health, average intelligence, and average income, if you were plucked out the air and dropped in either America or Scotland you’d have a much better chance of “freedom” (in terms of actual freedoms such as freedom from debt, freedom from incarceration, freedom to get educated, freedom to be healthy, etc.) in Scotland (or other similar western first world nations) than America.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " >In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare...  Your education and healthcare is not just \"free\". Citizens/tax payers are paying for it. If you make 9252 a year in GBP you'll be taxed 19% of your income. If you make the equivalent in USD, 12000 a year, you'll be taxed 10% of your income. That is half less than Scotland. On top of this, in the US,  you will also have the chance to benefit from many different government services that will provide free college, free healthcare, cheap housing, daycare, food stamps, etc. If you cannot receive these services you may get most of what you paid in taxes back in a refund.  Basically in Scotland you are forced to pay nearly twice as much in taxes for services that you may not ever want or use. So it is not free for you, or a freedom to choose.  &#x200B;  >... in America not only is healthcare not free, but it’s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment ...  This is capitalism at work. Doctors are recommending things that are clinically proven to work.   Sure they may pick one brand over another due to incentive, but it is still essentially the same. Also many people may get prescribed a brand but instead pick up a generic version that their insurance covers or is much cheaper.  And let's not forget that if you happen to live somewhere with universal healthcare and in a densely populated area, there will be long lines for a doctor visit. When doctors make less money, there will be less doctors. And when everyone can go in for any problem, for free, there will be more patients.  &#x200B;  >....your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you...  Only 8% of prisoners are in privatized prisons. For those 8%, I will agree with you.  &#x200B;  >.... I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings...  Maybe so. But not having guns would mean we depend solely on the police to protect us. On average, 67,000 lives are saved per year with fire arm self dense. There are around 1,000 people killed per year by police (this includes those who were aggressors). So I would say our guns are helping to secure our freedom, not take it away.   How easy is it to make over 150K in Scotland? How easy is it to start a company or launch a product? How easy is it to open up a store or restaurant?"

The gorilla rapes the human. But what happens if suddenly, the human changes their mind and consents. Is the human suddenly raping the gorilla, because the gorilla cannot consent? If the human came back a week later and the same event occured, but the human consents at the begining this time, did the human rape the gorilla?   I think beastiality should be illegal ONLY because it disgusts me, as ridiculous as that sounds. No ethical or moral basis to it.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Too many people in America are more than willing to throw out the presumption of innocence for specific crimes. This is spurred by the Deshaun Watson case, and subsequent signing by the Cleveland Browns.   Before I start, I want to be clear, I'm making ABSOLUTELY no judgments on his guilt or innocence or the integrity of his accusers.    However, the facts are a grand jury heard all of these cases and didn't find enough evidence to even bring them to trial.  That is a BIG DEAL.  Like grand juries really don't need much to move something forward.   He never even had official charges brought against him.   The public has seen no evidence, just knows there are accusations.  The grand jury saw the evidence the prosecution had, and decided there wasn't really enough there.  But so many people are acting like no team should have signed him after this happened.    If we are a country (if you live in the USA anyway) who believes in the presumption of innocence for the accused, then we shouldn't want others punished, even by their employer, based on just accusations.   Especially ones where there is a legal investigation and there isn't found to be enough evidence.    Hell, in many states, asking if you have been arrested isn't even allowed on applications.  They can ask if you have been convicted of a felony, but many places have decided that an arrest enough shouldn't bar people from employment without a conviction.  I'm just a random dude, but I've been arrested twice, and both times the cases were thrown out.  I'd hate for my company at the time, or even a future employer to look at that and use the \"well, SOMETHING bad must have happened for him to get arrested, so we shouldn't hire him\".  And I think that same grace to be applied to everyone.  Granted neither time was for sexual assault or anything.  But should the crime matter if there isn't evidence?  The problem seems to be WHAT he is accused of.  But I don't really think we should have different standards of \"innocent until proven guilty\" based on the crime.  And look, I get he is a public person, and they are held to different standards.  But should they be?  Its still a job, and people want him punished based solely on accusations.  But, by all accounts, we should be treating him as innocent.    And to reiterate.  I'm not saying his accusers are lying.  But should he, even in the court of public opinion, be treated as a criminal?  Absolutely not.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " > However, the facts are a grand jury heard all of these cases and didn't find enough evidence to even bring them to trial. That is a BIG DEAL....  It may be a minor point but you shouldn't put too much weight on the findings of a grand jury. There is a famous quote that a grand jury would \"indict a ham sandwich,\" and the same retired judge (if also convicted criminal) went on to state that they \"operate more often as the prosecutor’s pawn than the citizen’s shield.\"  The point of that quote is that a good prosecutor completely controls the grand jury, with them issuing indictments if and only if the prosecutor wants them. At the risk of getting into politics, grand juries were developed as a way to protect rich, white men from the criminal justice system, and US history is full of examples of them being used as cover for prosecutors (i.e. to justify decisions to prosecute usually non-white men when there was minimal evidence, and justifying decisions not to prosecute - often police officers or other people in positions of power - despite overwhelming evidence). In the US the prosecutor gets to decide what the grand jury sees and hears and as the jurors are bound to secrecy there are virtually no checks in place to ensure the prosecutor makes the best case possible (or doesn't exaggerate the case).  If you want a good example, the grand jury investigating the killing of Breonna Taylor failed to return an indictment of homicide against the people who killed her. The Kentucky Attorney General stated that the grand jury had \"agreed\" that shooting her had been justified. However some of the jurors risked breaking the law to comment on this, which led to the transcripts being unsealed (over the AG's objections) and it turned out the AG had refused to let the jury consider homicide charges (despite them asking about it), and muddled up self-defence laws.  The US is one of two countries that still use grand juries - the other being Liberia (whose constitution is modelled on the US's). That the US uses them is a quirk of historical timing more than anything else, but for over two hundred years they have been used to protect the powerful and persecute those without power."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered. One thing I will say isn’t going to change my mind: anecdotes of “my school already teaches this” unless you can show me that it’s already happening in a large number of schools.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I think you are looking for students being taught media literacy. Scientific literature requires a certain level of understanding of the subject matter. Like people from different disciplines of science may not even be able to read the material from each other's fields.

Using terms like \"common sense laws\" sounds like a marketing tactic to me that appeals to emotion and knee-jerk reactions rather than critical thinking.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: If the Simpsons, Big Mouth & Family Guy will no longer have white people voicing non white characters, Bob’s Burgers should no longer have males voicing female characters. So some voice actors & actresses have stepped away from some of their jobs of voicing fictional characters that are not the same ethnicity of them. The Simpson’s came under scrutiny for a while with one of their characters. Other popular shows had actors step down on their own.  One of the reasons given for the character on the Simpson’s being removed was that the character was causing harm by reinforcing negative stereotypes.   This got me thinking... if it is not socially okay for white people to play non what characters, why should it be okay for men to play women or even vice versa.  In the US there is a history of blacks not being allowed to perform on stage and parts were taken by white people in black race. Then even worse, minstrel shows solidly portrayed the negatives about black people as white people parades around in black face.  There is also history to women not being allowed to perform the same as men!  Women were not allowed on stage in many cultures. Prepubescent boys or castrated adolescences were often cast to play roles of women on stage.  Bob’s Burgers is a show that has several men voice women characters. Two main female characters of the family are voiced by men, four reoccurring female characters at the school are voiced by men and two other reoccurring male characters are voiced by women.   If there is an racial issue going on in the other shows with white people playing non white characters, why is it not seen as a sexist issue with men playing women? Do you think any of those men are doing harm as the white voice actor did for the Simpson’s character? Why should playing someone of a different sex be okay versus someone of a different race?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Here’s the best I’ve got: Hollywood has a way of making people of color invisible. They get fewer roles and have fewer roles available to them. If a character is black it is rarely because the best actor for the character was black, it’s because the character was written to be black only. This is a big problem, but at least black people are playing black characters. Cartoons have more leeway to have characters of color. That’s why Apu is the character to “start” the conversation. Because he started as a characeture (can’t spell it, I give up) and became a well rounded character. For YEARS he was the most sophisticated Indian character on TV. Because he was on a cartoon with a thousand characters, the Simpsons could experiment with characters of color on a show for the masses when many shows for the masses didn’t have them. But he’s played by a white guy, because it’s a cartoon. So there’s a conflict between the representation that the character provided and the whitewashing caused by the character.   Now, compare that with women in animation: almost all women are played by women. Bob’s burgers is the exception, not the rule. Because it’s the exception, it’s less problematic, because unlike actors of color, there are a lot of characters for women in Hollywood and more so in animation. Bart, possibly one of the most well known animated characters in the United States, is played by a woman. I see the double standard you’re talking about, but the problematic part of gender bent casting in cartoons isn’t as pronounced and possibly isn’t even problematic."

Therefore, eating eggs from a privately owned chicken, eating honey, and using wool should be considered vegan. Full disclosure, I am not vegan, but respect and support vegans. I am not here to bash vegans or veganism, only to discuss what I think should be considered vegan.  As far as I understand it, veganism as a lifestyle (not just as a diet) is about reducing harm to and not participating in the exploitation of animals. Obviously everyone has their own way of living a vegan life and veganism means something different to everyone, but in my opinion, there are certain ethical ways to use resources from animals.  * EGGS    * Hens lay eggs whether they're fertilized or not, so if someone owned a hen or two and ate the eggs that they were going to lay anyway, they are just making sure that those eggs aren't going to waste. This is different from buying eggs from a company that practices factory farming and has chickens for the sole purpose of profit, which would not be ethical. * HONEY    * Similarly, bees make honey whether or not anyone is there to harvest it, and they make more than they could possibly ever use. Taking the excess is, as I understand it, actually beneficial to the bees. In addition, beekeeping can be seen as a form of conservation, as bees are endangered, which I think is ethical. * WOOL    * Domesticated sheep need to be sheared regularly.

I also have bee hives. Bees are less endangered if you have the bees and don't take the honey.  So...making environments for bees seems wonderful, but making that environment's existence conditional on being able to steel their work-product seems a little disingenuous doesn't it?  They do make more than they need, but not if they are in an environment that has risks (like humans, bears - mine get taken out by a badger on occasion).    Domesticated sheep.  Difficult animals - ornery.  The sheep are indeed in need of sheering, but only because we've enslaved them for so long and bred them.  This seems a bit like beating your child for so long that they can't sleep anymore if you don't smack them with a stick and then saying \"i'm doing it as gift so my child can sleep\".  We've created this animal for all intents and purposes, we can't then excuse our use of them on the grounds that they need us.  We created the need.  The point is, it's _clearly_ exploitation.  We exploit the environment for our benefit all the time.  The bees do to, so do the sheep.  At some level, evolution tells us that the sheep are exploiting us by having us ensure their survival and the bees thrive because we fend of the badgers (not me, I fail at that repeatedly...but...in theory!)."

So, it is often taken for granted that the US (I will be using the US for this post, but this can be applied to any representative \"democratic\" body) that we have representative democracy.  We do not.  **If you \"vote\" for a candidate in a representative body that loses their election, you have no voice in our democracy.**  In order to give people true voices in their politics, we should move to affirmational representation.  This would mean the following:  1. Elections are just periods in which you can select your representative. 2. Any representative is now a member of that body representing  and casting X # of votes. 3. For ease of discussion and debate (US House of Reps example) only the top 435 representatives sit in the house for debate.  Others can cast votes, but not debate.  4. Voting inside the body will thus be based on total votes.  For example, you may need 150,000,000+ votes to pass a bill in the House of Reps in the United States. 5. Non-voters could be considered \"okay with any\" and their representation could be split proportionally amongst all eligible. 6. A person election to say \"none of these\" would be a vote of no confidence, and thus \"against\" any bill that comes before the body. 7.

    "golden_answer": " Most of the votes that take place in Democracy are winner takes all because the alternative is simply impractical. Let's use the example of a local election, such as voting for a mayor, or police chief. There is precisely one office to fill, and so the winner is whoever gets the most votes. Depending on your voting system, this will either be a FPTP system (highest individual total wins), or some form of run-off where the least popular candidate is struck and then secondary choices of his voters are applied, then the process repeats until someone has a majority (above 50%).  This means that there is no way to sensibly split the results without creating government bloat. In order for people's votes to \"not be wasted\", you would effectively need every office to have a committee of 3-5 (or more) equally-ranked people, filled proportional to the votes cast. This would not make society better - it would simply waste tax money and see that nothing is ever accomplished.  Moreover, any politician or elected official who isn't utterly stupid will pay attention to the elections that got them into power. If you win by the narrowest of margins, you will be fully aware that margin might disappear next election. This is why you find the most moderate candidates in 'swing' counties / districts / states, and the very worst candidates in safe seats. The former know they have to appeal to their rivals' voters if they want to maintain office, the latter know the sheep will keep them in power no matter how corrupt they are.  So you absolutely do have a voice, even if your candidate loses. If you find yourself in an absolute minority position where your chosen candidates are being utterly destroyed consistently, that isn't proof democracy is broken - it's proof you hold views completely out of alignment with your community, for better or worse."

It will actually make the problem worse  If we cancel student debt it means the taxpayers pay a ton of $$$$ to colleges and universities. So what will happen in a few more years when the next round of graduates are finished? Do we just forgive student debt again? and forever? This is the equivalent of bailing water out of a boat with a bucket but not fixing the hole in the boat. It will fill back up and we will be bailing again.  Why will the problem get worse? If we do this huge student debt cancellation (payoff with taxpayers $) college tuition prices will go up - why? Because colleges can charge whatever they want and the taxpayer will pay for it at the next bailout. We have seen over the past 30 years that universities will charge as much as they possibly can while still maintaining a high enrollment. Who wins? Universities and colleges because their tuition increases and is paid for by the taxpayer.  What needs to be done? Student loan financing reform - leading to TUITION REFORM! We need to limit the amount of student loans that each student is given. A set amount (much lower than current numbers) for undergraduate, post grad, doctorate, etc. If there are not students enrolled for the programs (because they cannot afford the tuition), over time the universities will lower their tuition to fill the seats. This is why tuition increased over the last 20+ years at an astonishing amount - because there is an almost unlimited amount of debt that a student can borrow and its all funded by the govt backed student loan program. Reduce the $$ available for student loans and the tuition will follow. That is how we fix the hole in the boat. Make educational prices reasonable again. Maybe universities wont be able to have buildings that cost hundreds of millions of dollars but that's ok.  After this has been completed we can then discuss how to help those that have already been ripped off recently - might require a one time student debt cancellation.     As only one example - Only in the US can you graduate from dental/medical school with $500k in student debt. HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?! That's insanity - even for a higher income profession. If you graduated 30 years ago from dental/medical school you probably would have about 40-50K in student debt. No one would have loaned you $500k in the 90s - and there was no tuition even close to that high.  There are  a lot of other factors to consider as well but all of this recent push to forgive student debt is crazy to me if we do not have a plan to fix the system.  Next year there will be more student debt that people cannot afford and we will be in the same discussion over and over.  Trillions of dollars.  Right now there is around $1,700,000,000,000 in US student debt.\n\nAssistant:",

Who wins? Universities and colleges because their tuition increases and is paid for by the taxpayer.  Universities aren't (generally) for-profit organizations operating in a supply-demand context, and tuition is usually a loss for them (subsidized by their endowment and by the government).  Prices have gone up because of reduced subsidies and unfunded mandates (and I suspect for a lot of universities increased local costs of living, hence increased wage expenses, probably play into it to).  Also bear in mind that most major universities are public.  We can require them to change their policies directly."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: I think it is ridiculous that people and the media throw a fit when illegal immigrants are deported. As of late, many different stories have risen about immigrants, some of which have been in the United States a long time, are being deported. I read an article today about a man who called the police for help. Afterward, he was handed over to ICE.   Immigrating to the United States illegally is obviously a crime. Crimes have punishments/courses of actions that are clearly presented in laws. Deportation is often the punishment for illegal immigration.   People seem to think that because an illegal immigrant has been in the United States for many years, that them being deported is wrong. If it was a bank robber who was caught 10 years after the fact no one would be upset that he faces his punishment. So I don’t think people should be upset when illegal immigrants are deported regardless of how long they have been here.   Note: I realize that some people are brought here as children. That makes things more complicated since that is not really their fault that they were brought here. It is their parents or guardians that brought them here illegally. However, it is not the United States government’s fault that they were brought here illegally by someone and no blame or anger should be directed at the government and ICE agents for carrying out the law regardless if previous administrations enforced the law or not.   Maybe I am not seeing people’s issue with the situation. It could be that they are saddened that someone has to uproot their life, but if we look at my example of the bank robber, is he/she not also being uprooted from their life?\n\nAssistant:",

Regardless of if you think we should do a more active job deporting immigrants, this is a particularly bad way to do it.  By setting precident that you can not get any help without likely being deported,  you are forcing these illegal immigrants to turn to alternative ways to resolve conflict.  Maybe they'll take the law into their own hand. Maybe they still need help, so they reach out to a local gang.  This goes further in that sometimes, law enforcement needs *their* help.

Drug addiction and mental health issues, in addition to desperate poverty, contribute to criminal records.  The solution to poverty is money, and one way to get money is by working a decent job. However, criminal records keep many of those in extreme poverty from decent employment.

In general, I think this should be illegal, but it should be especially illegal in jobs paying under a certain amount.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: No one has any real idea how to end homelessness in America I live in California, a state frequently criticized for its amount of homeless residents, and rightfully so since 20% of the nation's homeless resides in California (according to the non-profit streetsteam.org).   That is clearly a significant number, and it seems easy to point the finger at all of the policies created by Californian politicians that are not working. However, that is all it seems people ever do; no one provides a clear plan on how to truly fight homelessness. They may suggests providing more services for the homeless, while others say we need to provide more shelters to help them restart their lives. Some say we have enough of those services, the budget is bloated and we need to actually be stricter on who receives aid, in order to incentivize homeless individuals back in to working. No matter what opinion or idea I hear it all seems to be just a small alteration to what currently exist, rather than an actual solution. This is because no one actually has a solution.   California may house 20% of the homeless population, but homelessness is a nationwide epidemic. According to endhomelessness.org, as of 2018, the top 5 states with the most homeless were California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Washington. Before migrating to California, I lived in Connecticut and Florida. While in Connecticut I would frequently visit NYC which is has the highest concentration of homeless in the entire country, again according to endhomlessness.org. In Florida I lived on the panhandle in a town called Navarre which is adjacent to Pensacola. In this area I encountered less homeless people than NYC and CA but their presence was not minimal.  Texas, Florida, New York, and California, all large and popular states but very different places to live. The question is why are these states struggling so much with the homelessness? I would be willing to bet that these 4 states have some different policies on helping fight homelessness, but these different policies equal the similar results. At least, according to endhomelessness.org, TX, FL, and CA all had a drop in total homelessness since 2007, but admittedly CA drop was only 1%. The website seems to suggest this drop was mainly in homeless veterans, but that \"homeless individuals\" are experience far less progress.   While there has been progress across the country on homelessness, the country is still nowhere near a solution on dealing with the issue. While services exist that help shelter and support the homeless, they require a large amount of time, money, and effort from dedicated individuals to work closely with individual homeless people in order to help them rise. While every organization fighting homelessness needs more funding, providing more funding does not necessarily translate into a decrease in homelessness. This is due to the obstacles many homeless face in restarting their lives. Some are pulled back down by personal vices, such as drugs and alcohol, others are restrained by trauma and mental illness. Some homeless are unaware of the services out there to assist them, while others utilize every service they can only to struggle finding an employer willing to hire them. There are also many non-government groups that help fight homelessness such as streets team, the non-profit I cited earlier, and churches. These organizations do a great job and I encourage people to support them, but their efforts are not enough to ultimately combat the homeless epidemic.   I think everyone wants to fight and end homelessness. I think everyone wants those struggling to be treated with compassion. I think there are a lot of ideas currently argued that will \"solve\" the issue, but I do not think there is any clear answer on how to handle homelessness. CMV.\n\nAssistant:",

There are those that think people use the idea of \"thoughts and prayers\" in a dishonest or hypocritical posturing.  The most common example is in response to a school shooting.  The argument from their perspective is that prayer does nothing, so to **publicly offer prayers** is to posture oneselfs as moral while not actually doing anything which is dishonest; or even worse to do so while supporting republicans that don't support gun regulation, which makes the situation worse. 2. Telling someone that you are praying for them is often seen as very judgmental in certain situations.  OBviously not in cases like a family member dying, more in situations like where it's like \"I pray you can live you life in a better way\".  In either case the prayer itself isn't what people object to, it's the interactions people have with other regarding prayer that is disproved of, dishonest public posturing, or using the topic of prayer to judge/shame someone.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The shift from \"Art\" to \"Content Creation\" is degrading the artistic quality of creative works, and will continue to for the foreseeable future (Fresh topic) Hey all, this one is mostly for fun, but I do think a lot about how the internet and content consumption has an effect on creatives around the world. Definitely open to changing my view and also hearing different perspectives.  In recent decades, social media, YouTube and other internet platforms have become the main places many people go to consume media and spend their free time. This obviously has had a huge impact on creatives, and we see a huge number of aspiring \"Content Creators\" and less aspiring \"Artists.\" In my argument, I'm using Artist as a blanket statement to include anyone who makes creative works. Musicians, authors, poets, visual artists, filmmakers, etc.  ***Artistic quality*** is something that is obviously subjective and up for debate, but I think many kinds of content are blatantly non-artistic, and it would be hard to argue that they are. Examples: Let's Play Youtube channels, reaction channels, Instagram and Snapchat influencers, many many subreddits, the vast majority of TikTok videos, many podcasts, etc. While I am open to debating what is of artistic value, I would say works that qualify as artistic and having lasting quality have some qualifications:  \\- The act of creating, and the work itself is emotionally expressive for the creator. It also is typically seen as an artistic, self-expressive act by the creator.  \\- The work provokes an emotional, meaningful, or thought provoking response in those engaging with it.  \\- It has a lasting cultural effect or meaningful impact on society.  \\- It is, well... creating something that wasn't there before! Someone making ***anything*** that expresses their inner world, to me, is inherently more artistic than a video of you doing squats at the gym.  It's obvious to see that these platforms function in an inherently different way than all other creative or artistic platforms in human history, and thus effect the artistic works made for the platforms. All social media websites are driven on user engagement, with the algorithms that drive these websites solely focused on ***keeping users on their platform as long as possible.*** This by itself is going to change the nature of the media made for these platforms - users are no longer rewarded for creating works that have higher ***quality,*** or have a thought provoking or lasting effect on society, they are only rewarded for creating works that are immediately eye catching, or keep users engaged for this exact moment, only to be forgotten about seconds later quite often. Obviously this feedback loop will lead to people who shape their lives around creating content for these platforms, and will make works that lead to user engagement.   Does this change in mentality, the change to a \"Content Creator\" lead to less artistically valuable works being made on the whole? I think, in general, it does. Many platforms incentivize creators to constantly be pushing out new content, and I think this is antithetical to the quiet contemplation many artistic works require. I think many people who might have opted to be an author before YouTube became huge might choose now to make a film analysis channel, or something similar, due to the instant feedback and ability to reach more people, as opposed to spending months or years doing research and writing a novel alone. There are more people opting into a less artistic platform, and making less quality creations as a result. There is also much less of a focus on originality and/or artistry, and more of a focus on entertainment  Things to address about my argument and things that will change my view:  \\- I hope this isn't coming off as pretentious - I don't think these platforms are bad for ***society*** or anything like that, they are just bad for ***artistic creation!***  \\- If you can prove that on the whole, there are more quality creative works being made now than there were previously. I mean heck, maybe only 3% of all YouTube channels are actually of artistic quality, but maybe that's more than there used to be during the hayday of Television, Radio and film. (Please link your artistically pleasing sources here!)  \\- If you can change my mind on what criteria is important when determining artistic value - I'm open to having my view changed on this, have fun with it!  \\- If you can show me other platforms or other avenues that creators are disseminating their original artistic works, and are incentivized on originality. Bandcamp is a good example.  \\- If you can argue that in the future, it won't always be this way, and that while at the moment this is the effect that algorithms are having on content creation, that for some reason it will actually have a ***positive*** impact on artistic value, eventually.\n\nAssistant:",

In truth, the majority of “art” over the centuries has been what one might call “content creation”—cheap pamphlets, pulp magazines, gossip columns, commercial illustration, one hit wonders, bad sitcoms, etc. The thing is, we don’t remember any of that any more than we will a specific YouTube makeup tutorial in a hundred years from now.

If the N word was yelled at a group of black people with intent to cause emotional harm and devalue them as humans and people there are many more who would find that offensive. The word is the same.

Blizzard had to act in order to prevent its content (and platform) from being hijacked for political purposes. 3. Blizzard probably went too far in its punishment of the player and the casters. 4. However, the reaction, and the backlash, as you put it, have been completely out of proportion as well.  5. The amount of effort, and noise, as you put it, seen on reddit seem to me to be the symptom of Blizzard being the easiest thing to virtue signal, or have a group outrage, about. It's very within Reddit's base to have a Blizzard account, and for such persons to have viable alternatives to Blizzard, that it was the \"cheapest\" way of making a statement. No similar campaign was made of Disney, Apple, NBA, or indeed any other company or company representative that took a stand on Hong Kong. 6. If the stated aim is to pressure the Chinese government, then Blizzard is absolutely the wrong target as well - the Chinese Govt certainly doesn't care about any Blizzard boycott. The Chinese players of Hearthstone aren't affected by your boycott either - in fact, they would probably benefit if Blizzard would focus more attention on their market as opposed to the West. 7. Blizzard, as a private company and not a govt, cannot censor anything. They are free to decide what messages go out on their product, same as how Chick-fil-a is free to decide not to open on Sunday.

Recently when that woman from Apple resigned after saying that 12 white men in a room could be diverse because of their experiences I had a sudden epiphany for what may be wrong with conversations on diversity these days.  To me, the central issue is that our understanding of diversity is only 'observable' diversity.     I've lived and worked in many different cities, especially those with diverse populations such as Singapore, Doha, New York and London. One thing I've learned is to never assume anything about anyone. That blonde haired blue-eyed guy might be muslim, that calm and married with 3 kids desi lady might ride motorbikes lit on fire on the weekend (true story) - etc. Stereotypes might come from a basis of experience, but I've experienced so many exceptions that mine are a little bit more loosely held than they used to be.     My point is that if our only understanding of diversity is based on what can be initially observed about someone, then what the hell are we really talking about? This person has X colored skin, this person has Y disability, this person has Z political perspective or W religion as seen by an artifact on their body? What the heck? Aren't we better than that? I saw a Japanese woman with a fish bracelet the other day and I thought it was a Jesus fish, but she corrected me and said \"oh I just thought it was a cute fish.\" I think that this entire debate on diversity just shows how overall divided we still are, if people really understood diversity, they would stop talking about what people look like and focus on just ensuring and equal opportunity of success for everyone and combat destructive groups of any kind, regardless of their target.     From my experience, you could dream up the most incredibly diverse board of directors, representing somehow through mixed blood every minority race, religion, disability and personal diet and if they all have the same tactics in common, you'll have a LESS diverse output of strategy from that executive suite. Real diversity is accepting everyone, making things more colorful/differently shaped is an attempt at a shortcut that ultimately doesn't make sense.

The problem is that it is increasingly difficult to claim that you are ignorant of the racist message the flag sends, whether or not that is your intent.  When I was a kid, people romanticized the flag. It represented that irrepressible rebel spirit that all Americans were supposed to cherish. In many people's eyes, the Civil War was very similar to the Revolutionary War, with a very different outcome for the rebels. Even though the North won, the fact that the South fought nobly and well against an opponent with all of the advantages speaks to something deep in our scrappy souls (cf. John Cougar Mellencamp's Authority Song). We're supposed to stand up to the man (cf. Johnny Paycheck's Take This Job and Shove It) and we don't let people tread on us.  That's why you put a flag decal on the back of your pickup truck. Not because you thought slavery was a good idea. And, at least where I was from, there just weren't that many black people to be offended...and they probably would have felt very awkward saying anything. So people just continued in blissful ignorance until, probably within the last 20 years, there was a growing awareness that it just wasn't okay.  Now, you have a bunch of people being called out for doing something that they didn't consider remotely racist. That certainly wasn't their intent. They're good people, and it's not their fault if people misinterpret the reason that they fly the flag. In fact, this is just one more example of The Man trying to tell them what they can say and do. I guess it's time to rebel against PC culture and school or working environments that make assumptions about you just because you're white and working class. The fact that they probably can't win just makes the struggle that much more beautiful."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The theory that eliminating tipping would cause the restaurant industry to collapse is a conspiracy perpetuated by waitstaff and the restaurant industry Tipping is optional. Period, point blank, no ifs, ands, or buts. It’s a customers choice whether they want to tip or not and how much. The idea it is mandatory is solely based on guilt and societal pressure to conform at the detriment of the customer and the benefit of the business and waitstaff.  The customer experiences unnecessary pressure to pay an arbitrary amount of money simply for going out to eat. Meanwhile the waitstaff benefit by making often more than minimum wage. Even more so the  business benefits by having the customer pay their employee wages and put pressure on the waitstaff to turn over tables further making them more money. Imagine if Amazon decided to implement this pay scheme. They decide they’re going to pay their workers less than minimum wage and you foot the bill by adding a tip to your order. People wouldn’t stand for this and would be at Amazons throat. So why in this instance is the customer, who just wants to sit and eat, the enemy, instead of the person who decided to start a business and have someone else pay for it?   As well back of house usually isn’t getting tipped and some of them make less than the waitstaff. Where’s the outrage?  People keep pushing the idea that somehow eliminating tips is going to lead to the collapse of the restaurant industry or food prices are going to skyrocket.

Not tipping in areas for which low income earners depend on tips is morally reprehensible and people will continue to morally condemn and judge you for it.  Not viewing you as an immoral person is optional.  A service industry that didn't depend on tips is very conceivable.  In most if not all of Europe, tips are much less expected.  It is reasonable to want to switch from the US system to the European system.  It is not reasonable to make some of the lowest wage earners pay for that transition.  If you don't like the culture of tipping, you can campaign for laws that don't exempt service workers from minimum wage, and you can boycott restaurants where tips are expected.  But, if you, in order to try to change the country to the way you want it to be, decide the way to do that is for you to make no sacrifices at all, and instead inflict that burden on some of the most economically vulnerable, you taint your own cause."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Universal basic income will, in the long term, entrench inequality When the  subject of a universal basic income (UBI) comes up, people often give the same arguments: it will reduce poverty; it will make welfare more efficient by simplifying administration; and it will make labour fairer by providing an alternative to either starving or getting trapped in a cycle of low-paid exploitative jobs.  Critics tend to say that UBI will make people lazy by removing the incentive to work, that it's useless because companies will simply pass on any loss in profits to consumers, or that the money just doesn't exist for it.  Personally, I think that UBI would probably be fairly effective at accomplishing its aims, and that while it might disrupt our society significantly we would adapt. I think the resulting society might even be better for the poorest. Feel free to challenge this, but it's not really my main argument.  I'm concerned that if UBI is implemented, it would, in the long term, entrench inequality. Here are my assumptions:  1. The biggest inequality is between those that earn money through capital and those that earn money by wages. The majority of people will never earn enough money through a salary to rival those who own lots of capital. UBI wouldn't change this, because the gap to be closed is orders of magnitude too large. 3. UBI would, presumably, be largely paid for by the rich, but won't be so damaging to accumulated wealth that the inequality between labour and capital reduces significantly. If UBI cost enough to do this, I don't see how it could be sustainable once those fortunes are exhausted. At that point, society would be forcibly redistributing capital, which is a lot further than most people are willing to go. 2. Income from UBI would largely be spent on the same things most people's salary already goes towards: rent (or a mortgage), food, and so on. Either UBI makes a big difference to a person, in which case it will likely go towards essentials, or it's just an extra supplement on top of a satisfactory salary---nice to have, but not going to make a person rich.  So inequality remains, albeit hopefully with the reduction or disappearance of abject poverty. The rich continue to get richer because people still need to pay them for food and rent and so on, and the poor are slightly less poor. People are generally more comfortable, so the risk of revolution lowers and politicians are placed under less pressure to further reduce inequality. Inequality between capital and labour is already higher than it was on the eve of WWI, and there is no reason to think that it will reduce or even level off without any external factors.  I imagine that it's obvious from the question that I'm no economist, so please keep your answers accessible for a layperson. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

This gradually closes the gap between the upper and lower classes until eventually all (or most) work is automated and there is (little or) no gap.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Donald Trump played the Republican Party and is not a Republican I personally believe President Donald Trump is not a Republican by value, but a Fascist.  I do not throw that word around, and I do not mean it as an insult, I literally mean he is a fascist.     Let me first expose why I don’t believe he is a Republican or has Republican values: 1.\tDonald Trump is “very pro choice”.  He stated this in an interview in 1999 on Meet The Press. 2.\tDonald Trump has a very limited knowledge of the Bible.  I know this is a stretch, but the GOP in the US has very strong Biblical beliefs, and many of their stances are based around said book (against gay marriage, pro life, etc).  This came to fruition when he mispronounced II Corinthians as “two Corinthians”, and even more so when he stated he never asked for forgiveness because he doesn’t do anything bad. 3.\tDonald Trump wants to expand government’s power over it’s citizens, not reduce it.  He stated last year that he’s a fan of Eminent Domain, and is actively using it to acquire land near the Mexican border for his wall.  Through his cutting back of funding for the EPA (which educates and provides regulations that keep air and water more clean), the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor.     My support for him being a fascist: 1.\tHis leaning towards a corporatist economic system.  He is promoting massive tax cuts for wealthy companies, but hardly touching small, 100 employees or less companies.  Removing the restrictions of Dodd-Frank, which protects individuals from predatory lending and collection practices is one such move. 2.\tAttempting to discredit media.  We can all agree that MSM has it’s own agenda, that really isn’t what’s up for discussion here.  What is, however, is his attempt to decide what is “true” and “fake” news.  He has labeled CNN as “Fake News”, while praising Fox and Friends.  He seems to do this not on a basis of fact/fiction, but on a basis of whether or not they agree with him.  Just yesterday, during the FBI and NSA hearings, he called the hearings “Fake News” even though they were literally happening while he was tweeting about it.  He is attempting to claim a monopoly on the truth. 3.\tPower through military.  His budget proposal cuts social welfare programs, environmental protection programs, and education programs to bolster our already large military.   4.\tAttempting to discredit other branches of government.  We all remember that “SEE YOU IN COURT!” tweet he put out as he lost a court battle regarding the banning of people from certain nations, but the courts aren’t the only one.  He has bashed Congress several times over the past few years, and especially during the election.  Claiming the courts are “liberal” (ie. Against what he wants) if they find him wrong, and supporting those that agree with him. 5.\tHis history of alleged sexual abuse.  Mussolini labeled women as “reproducers of the nation” and recommended against employing them.  It’s almost as though Trump shares this view and sees them as objects rather than human beings.  Whether it’s walking into the changing rooms at pageants or “grabbing them by the *****”, or the several allegations of sexual misconduct against him, we have to admit his history with women is a bit rocky at best. 6.\tRacial/National division.  Trump has repeatedly kicked minorities out of his rallies, including some who claim to have been legitimately there to learn his stances.  His quotes on people from Mexico and Muslims go without saying as well.  “A ban on all Muslims from entering the country” is one of his campaign promises.  Most people will say “Muslim’s aren’t a race”, but let me clarify: a race is just a shared characteristic between groups of people.  It doesn’t have to be physical color.  It can be nationality, religion, skin color, disability, etc. I am posting this here legitimately out of trying to understand where he stands.  I’m not trying to attack his character, nor his position in government.  I’m just a naturally curious person and would like to see what you all think about this as well.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: There needs to be a tax on harmful food additives and a tax cut on foods without them. Basically everything we see in the grocery store has too much stuff added into it. Added sugars and salts because they're natural preservatives, for instance. Roughly 90 percent of America's 3.5 trillion dollars of aggregate health care expenditure comes from chronic illnesses. The most dangerous of these illnesses (Besides the ones caused by cigarettes and alcohol) are mostly based on having a poor diet and exercise life. Those are of course obesity, diabetes and heart disease.  So, I'm looking for an idea that will try to tilt the economics and incentives of shopping for food in favor of healthy alternatives. I stumbled upon the idea of having a tax directly on the harmful components of food. So if an individual packaged food product has over 5% daily value of sodium, it's communicated directly into the sales tax for that product. So if it has 10% of daily value, then the sales tax would be 5%. You could work this in for excess sugars, saturated and trans fats, artificial preservatives and all manner of harmful components in food.   Obviously I don't expect cashiers at a grocery store to sit there and calculate the sales tax based on whatever is in the package. It would have to be handled by computers that would communicate the contents of what they've ordered from manufacturers directly into inventory so that it's automatically applied at the cash register and visible on the price tag on the shelf.  I understand that there would be necessary exceptions to the rule. Salt shakers for example. If a full salt shaker has 1000x your daily value of sodium, you can't very well charge 1000x the price of the product in a sales tax.  I also understand that since sugar and salt are natural preservatives, they are critical to the infrastructure of food transportation. That and the fact that sodium is very healthy for you up to a certain point are the reasons why you would start charging the tax after a daily value of 5 or 10 percent. Some sodium is necessary. It's also the case that if a food product requires that much preservation just to get to the supermarket, then it's either from too far away or it's probably not a good food product.  I see a lot of potential for this to really change people's eating habits. Ultimately, something needs to be done about American health issues stemming from diet. I don't want these taxes to range so high that it starts bankrupting companies so fast that they don't have time to change their product process. I also would want the government to properly fund diet and health related programs to better help this transition into hopefully slightly healthier lifestyles.  Let me know if you have any objections as to the efficiency or legality of such a tax. Also let me know if there are better systems of dealing with America's lack of dietary integrity.

The United States needs to set term limits on the basis of age for Congress and the President.  70+ year olds are frequently regarded as unemployable due to mental decline and disconnect with the current times, but a high number of them are serving as politicians in the United States. The oldest sitting Senator, Senator Feinstein is 88 and has served since 1992. Over twenty members of the Senate are in their 70s. President Biden is 78 years old, and his health and mental prowess are the subject of continuous scrutiny. The most extreme example, Senator Thurmond, served for just short of 50 years until he passed away at 100. Currently, the average age of House members is \\~58 years old and that of the Senate is \\~63 years old. Contrast this with the average age of the American citizen, \\~38 years old.   All too often members of Congress demonstrate their age and disconnect with the times when they must talk about social media, tech, the internet, etc. with tech giants during hearings on the Hill.   Term limits would prevent leaders from turning holding office into a career, spending upwards of 30-40 years serving in office and hanging on until they can barely function in an official capacity. Term limits would bring new and fresh perspectives into Congress. Limiting time in office would also hinder the development of permanent relationships among politicians and interest groups/lobbyists. Yes, they would still occur, but they would come to an end once the official’s term expired.  I recognize the increased turnover would lead to a larger number of politicians who are not as familiar with the legislative process as someone who has been in the office for over a decade. But wouldn’t this also provide a motivation to train their successors and offer apprenticeship/mentorship opportunities like that seen in other communities?    We have minimum age requirements for someone to serve in the House, Senate, or presidency, so why shouldn’t we create a maximum?

    "golden_answer": " The Non-aggression Principle (NAP) that libertarians espouse leads *directly* to anarcho-capitalism when consistently applied. Libertarian philosophy is deontological: No Stealing, Period. And taxes are theft. Therefore taxation is never justified. Therefore all government, which must rely on taxation, is by definition illegitimate. QED.   Even if government were somehow voluntarily funded, government is a monopoly on the use of force. It must necessarily initiate force against any competitors who try to take the government's place. Therefore the government necessarily violates the NAP, and is illegitimate. QED.   Any \"minarchist\" libertarian is always vulnerable to attack from anarcho-capitalists (ancaps), who can argue that they are applying libertarian principles inconsistently. And the ancaps are right. If taxation (theft) is ever justified from a consequentialist point of view (as opposed to the deontological argument against it), i.e. if we can tax \"for the greater good,\" then that opens the door to liberalism/progressivism/socialism. It is pretty much an indisputable fact that a dollar in the pocket of a rich man produces less happiness for him than the same dollar in a homeless person's pocket. Why not redistribute, at least a little bit? The minarchist is stuck between a rock and a hard place, and will have to double down on libertarian principles in order to defend against progressive views of government. That means they will be driven in into the ancap camp.   So in conclusion, people are right to ascribe anarcho-capitalism to more mainstream libertarians because it is the logical consequence of their beliefs.   I will concede however that it is logically possible for a purely utilitarian/consequentialist libertarian to exist, who argues for deregulation and free markets based purely on their supposed benefits to the greater good, and not on any inherent value of liberty (as defined by the NAP). However, I don't think that any such libertarians exist, or at least I've never come across one (if you know any please point them out). The NAP is central to their belief system, kind of like how belief that Christ is the Lord and Savior is central to the Christian belief system. The utilitarian arguments for the free market are secondary, and the libertarian can always retreat to the NAP if they are challenged. Similarly, a Christian may deploy Pascal's Wager as an argument for believing in God, but that's not the real reason they believe and if challenged, they can retreat to their core faith.   The core faith of libertarians is the NAP. And the NAP leads to anarcho-capitalism. If anarcho-capitalism is crazy, then mainstream/unprincipled libertarianism is also crazy. QED.   Note: I have some familiarity with libertarians since I used to be one. And I was led to anarcho-capitalism based on my study of libertarian theorists such as Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Hans Herman-Hoppe, and Walter Block. That was a long time ago and I am a progressive now, an anarcho-communist/socialist. So I don't think anarchism is crazy, just specifically the anarcho-capitalist variety.

It's definitely another topic to argue why this is the case, but the starting point should be assuming it's one of the many possibilities of a non-reality, rather than blindly assuming it's the one real top-level genuine reality. But that aside, if you believed the world was an illusion in some form, would it not be better to go one level deeper if it meant you felt a more positive experience?  \\- Any feeling of 'greater good' you have, or feeling/intention about continuing the human race and ensuring our survival, you will feel that but to a more satisfying extent.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Bernie Sanders lost because he was not a good presidential candidate This is going to controversial on Reddit, but I don't care. I genuinely think that Bernie Sanders lost because he was not a good a presidential candidate this election cycle. He really ran a bad campaign and lost on his own merits.  In 2016, the Bernie campaign was a beast. It was relatable, it was energetic, and it fought for things that people wanted. He kept his campaign short and focused. His campaign tuned in on a few big policies people cared about (medicare for all, free collage for all, $15/h min wage). His 2020 campaign is a shell of that. The way he ran and branded his 2020 campaign was a failure by the numbers. His polling stagnated and never grew until all the other candidates dropped out, and it only increased by a bit relatively speaking. He also lost all the key states and either lost or had a smaller win in many of the states that he dominated in 2016.  But beyond this, Bernie proved himself to be a bad candidate. For starters, he ignored the American people. Americans want a healthcare system that is universal and affordable, but they didn't want the private healthcare to be eliminated. What did Bernie do? He doubled down on eliminating private healthcare. His platform took another hit when he added ludicrous things like a federal job guarantee and housing for all as actual policies. He also gave the finger to a lot of his supporters when he literally went out and praised Fidel Castro. Like he gave his opponents all they need to justify their claims that he's a socialist. Him doubling down on calling himself a democratic socialist (and before you start, and I KNOW that some of you will. Social democracy and democratic socialism are not the same and they are NOT interchangeable) didn't help either.  But beyond questionable labels and policies, the thing that really screwed him is his base. Bernie is divisive character. His entire platform revolves around the rich vs the poor and most of his speeches have him demonizing the right (which made them double down). This type of attitude is reflected in his base who have become the most toxic supporters of any candidate in the 2020 election, including Trump. They have attacked every single candidate and their supporters. Warren, Pete, Yang, Gabbard, Klobuchar, Biden, Harris, etc. This isn't a few bad eggs, this sort of behavior is the norm irl and online. They attack (not criticize, attack) the candidate's integrity, the intelligence of their supporters, the candidate's human decency, etc. And when a candidate does drop out they come in demanding support. It's not only the candidates, this behavior also applies the voting blocs. If you were a moderate, then you were demonized for not caring about others. If you were a right winger, you were just straight up evil. If you were a progressive who didn't support Bernie, then you were branded as a traitor or a snake. If you're slightly critical of Bernie then you're branded as a Trump supporter. Oh, and whenever something doesn't go their way it's always either Bernie getting cheated or some grand conspiracy involving the establishment (Deep State 2: Electric boogaloo). This is a really big problem and everybody knows it, and Bernie did nothing about it. This frustrated and turned away enough people to the point where winning the election wasn't possible for him.  Bernie losing in 2020 is all on him and his supporters. He wasn't a good candidate, he didn't run a good campaign, and he didn't have a friendly base.  I know a lot of my statements are vague and all over the place, but I'm more happy to go in depth. This post hasn't been a draft for months now, and I just wanted to share my thoughts.  Also please try to avoid whataboutism, this post is solely about Bernie.

Coming in 2nd place out of 29 is an incredibly good showing.  While I personally wasn't a fan of Bernie's universal healthcare proposal, it was still an important keystone to his campaign that helped distinguish him from the other candidates at a time when that was both very important and very difficult and that many of his supporters clung to and still cling to as an important policy change that they believe *needs* to happen.  Even without a successful presidential nomination, he still did a lot to popularize his policy goals."

It goes without saying that the body positivity movement has been beneficial for women of all different shapes and sizes world wide; comprehensive, and intersectional discussions about things from stretch marks, to body hair, to  cellulite - and I’m all for these things. Women deserve to be confident in their skin, with their bodies, and free from superficial judgements levied against them by their peers or themselves.   Men, on the other hand, have been left in the dust. Look at the top 5 social media accounts that turn up when you search body positivity - they are not only run by women, but usually geared towards women, with some rare exceptions of particularly progressive accounts which may have some representation for Trans and non-binary folks.   Men’s bodies are still, in large, viewed in the dichotomy of attractive, or not, with less wiggle room on top traits men tend to be insecure about, whether they can help it (e.g usually physical fitness) or not (e.g previously listed issues for women, height, penis size, baldness, etc.)  Of course, I’m not suggesting some incel-mindset “these men don’t deserve love” or “beta versus alpha” propaganda, nor am I suggesting men necessarily require this kind of social support,  but the last bit discussion about men’s bodies had to do with the “dad-bod” craze of the mid-2010s, which still focused on large part on a specialized aspect of men, rather than a respect for their body the way the discourse surrounding body-positivity did for women.  I speculate these things don’t exist for men in part because of societal expectations on men as to be less concerned with their physical appearance (as not to be perceived as being girly/ supporting traditional gender roles) or show weakness regarding sense of self towards others (also gender roles.) However I also think their exclusion from the origin of body positivity may have inadvertently closed the door in the face of many men willing to open up regarding body identity.  With all that being said, I realize men, and women, and people in general cannot be generalized so simply. I know there are men unconcerned and comfortable in their own skin just as much as their are men willing to talk and require the help from communities online and in person, and I know there are many content creators who want to have men at the table to normalize discussions, but by in large, the “movement” of body positivity has long since left men behind.\n\nAssistant:",

It's debatable whether they truly even believed in environmentalism, or if they were just using it as a thinly-veiled excuse for their bigotry.   Another thing is there is no guarantee that both sides will work together long enough for actual progress to be made.

If the story was about a racecar driver getting stuck in some town, you could pretty much tell the same story with human characters, and it would actually make a lot more sense.  It requires a level of suspension of disbelief that isn't really required in any other Pixar franchise.  Who built the cars, where did their infrastructure come from, how do they do all this stuff with no hands, was lightning McQueen built a racecar or did he turn into one, how does romance work between cars?    Every other Pixar movie seems to have a much more grounded premise.  The toys in your bedroom are alive and want to be played with, the monsters in your closet need your scream energy, there are ants in an epic struggle against grasshoppers, here is a rat that aspires to be a chef. Etc.  Cars?  Ehh, it feels more like, \"we need to produce another movie franchise with a marketable toy line like Toy Story.\" And I think more cynical critics and adult audiences understand that's what's happening.  Ive only watched the first Cars (numerous times because I also have a young son), but none of the others (they aren't on Netflix where I live.), And I really liked it.  I thought the story was good, the visuals were great, and it had nice character development.  As far as character list, I liked lightning and doc, Sally was... fine but a bit of a cookie cutter.  Mater is ok for comic relief.  The 2 Italian cars were pretty good.  I also liked mac.  The other townspeople are mostly forgetable. Pixar has made more memorable bit characters in other movies.

The rest were either collisions with other objects or non-collision events (e.g. turning too sharply and rolling the vehicle).  Source: https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812806   American driving education is a joke. It mostly focuses on reading and abiding by assorted traffic signs. It's a relatively short course. It culminates in a written test and a short bit of driving that requires the most basic of operation to drive and park. After that, there's typically a period where you hold a learner's permit and adult supervision in required, and after that you're fully licensed and free to drive. It's quite easy and you'd have to be some kind of moron to be unable to pass it. I do not feel like it adequately prepares drivers before putting them onto the road. Presumably the intent is that it's best for people to learn while actually driving, but the problem is people don't. Many people are ill-equipped to handle aggressive urban traffic. Some are even incompetent when it comes to basic navigation. I'm not even talking older people who used to be able to drive and are losing it, I'm talking about younger people that simply aren't cognitively nimble when it comes to operating a vehicle, and I blame their driving instruction.  The common retort is that many parts of the US are unfeasible to live without a car and license, largely because of how spaced out everything is, coupled with inadequate public transportation. I am 100% on board with expanding public transit. I wish more American cities had capable train networks. I once visited Washington DC and the subway system was fantastic. I didn't have a rental car and didn't need one. That's not really relevant, because I don't think driving is difficult enough that normal people can't pass a harder test if they are properly instructed. People who are handicapped might not, but they shouldn't be driving anyway. For normal people, I don't see any reason they can't get good at driving with proper instruction.   Also, it's not just about driving technique and operation. I expect a huge part is about vehicle maintenance. Of the numbers that I posted, the part I think is the most eye-opening is that stat about what people hit, and that most collisions are NOT with a moving vehicle. Now certainly alcohol is responsible for part of that (29% of fatal crashes). Certainly texting and other distractions are responsible for many others. However, I would venture that improper maintenance makes up some of that. It is hugely important to have tires that are appropriate for the season/climate, and with an adequate amount of tread. It is also hugely important to have brakes that can stop your car quickly and efficiently. If you car has an airbag recall, it's critical that the airbags are serviced in accordance with the recall. I had a car with an airbag recall, and a few years later I used the airbag in a frontal collision. I was relieved to get a big poofy bag of air instead of a bunch of plastic shrapnel. Vehicle safety measures are important. Yet, most of the country doesn't even have safety inspections; it's mostly just most of the east coast (from North Carolina to Maine), Texas, Louisiana, and Missouri. In all the other states, there is none. That means people can drive with bald tires and other assorted defects and no one is likely to stop them until they get pulled over for something unrelated or they hit something. The necessity of safety inspections is a CMV for another time, but the relevant question then becomes why people might have faulty equipment. Certainly cost is a likely culprit, but I'd venture ignorance is a close second. In my observations, people take the importance of tires and brakes for granted.   My overarching point is that there's a lot of things that a driver and vehicle owner needs to know and do if the public as a whole is to be safe on the road, and it's all too easily to get licensed without being competent or knowledgeable to be safe. I prescribe more rigorous licensing with stricter requirements. Europe is regarded as having a more stringent standard for drivers, and I don't see any reason the US can't either. CMV.   Note: I will not accept \"self-driving vehicles make this a moot point\". If your only refutation involves vehicles driving themselves, I will ignore you.

Between alcohol, not wearing a seatbelt, speeding, and distracted driving, you explain over 90 percent of deaths.

I believe there should be a MANDATORY re-application with an accompanying driving exam to re-new a citizens drivers license after age 75.   The most recent stat I’ve seen is that at age 65, 1-in-3 Americans have some form of vision-impairing eye condition. Elderly ppl are also combating deteriorating motor skills and hand/eye coordination that gets worse as humans age.

I’d love to hear other people’s opinions taking the opposite side of this belief - am I missing something?   I don’t see the downside in affirming someone 75+ years old can safely operate a vehicle. But the upside is it will eliminate unsafe elderly drivers and save lives.   In the past...I would have accepted the argument that elderly need to be “independent” and be able to run errands, etc. however, with the advances in technology & mobility (ie: Uber & Lyft for transportation, Postmates & grubhub for food, Instacart for groceries, Amzn prime for.....everything, etc) there is virtually nothing someone couldn’t acquire by using a 3P vendor /app. and for pharmaceutical Rx / health / etc there are companies like Capsule who deliver prescription drugs to your doorstep. If any of those options are economically challenging, there are vast public transportation networks that are also viable options.

To say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us, while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to Nazis and Hitler. Essentially, making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics.   Now, I’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics.

Of course we're all different and there are exceptions.  For example Pete Davidson (SNL) used to tell a joke about how he didn't care when his mother told him his firefighter father died in 9/11 because he was seven and she got him a PS3 right after. I think that's a funny concept, because he's joking about his *own* tragedy. Not someone else's. In that context I think it's perfectly fine.

I think modern high-level languages should not use NaN. My reasoning is:  * You still have to check for NaN at the end.

My view is that countries “in the west” should coerce China to stop this activity and if it led to the use of military force then so be it.  The counter-argument both parties I’ve talked to with have said that it is not “the west’s” job to impose its views on other countries (effectively anti-imperialism) and that morality is subjective, something I disagree with strongly in the situation of right to freedom.  I also feel this way about North Korea, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia. “The west” should intervene in any country where basic human rights are not respected.  Wherever there are people who are oppressed by a regime, it is morally reprehensible, to me, to not use every method available to assist them.   The argument to me that “they will figure it out for themselves” is completely devoid of humanity.

Imagine a society where women are in a separate social class between livestock and people, and where the overwhelming majority of both sexes are more or less fine with that.  Every social and religious institution functionally supports that norm, and the people are so accustomed to poverty that they can't really be coerced by the threat of deprivation.  You can maybe give them incentives to change, but they feel no great need to honor such agreements beyond absolute necessity - when cash stops flowing or you stop supervising, they just go back to doing what they did before.  How do you change them?  You'd need to perpetrate a cultural genocide via a de facto police state that fundamentally rearranged their social order.

It was their lack of action which was a contributing factor.  On the other hand, negligence has been used to punish circumstances where parents refuse medical treatment for their children.  These two Canadian parents were found guilty of criminal negligence causing the death of their 14 month old child.

Moreover, absent a prevailing interest that could outweigh the value of these freedoms, I believe that right to work laws should be struck down or repealed.  My basic view is this: when a group of workers collectively bargain with an employer they can request almost anything as a term in their contract. They can ask for dental coverage, different work hours, a dozen roses, etc. Collective bargainers have an interest, in these negotiations, in a contract that bolsters the union and discourages free riders on union benefits. As a consequence, unions often aim to develop contracts that discourage employers from hiring non-union workers or hiring non-union workers that are exempt from union dues.  It seems to me that whether the employer accepts this term is up to the employer and nobody else. If an employer accepts a contract that requires, as a term, that the employer only employ unionized employees, then that's on the employer. Non-unionized employees have no standing right to interfere with the employer's freedom to contract with the union or their freedom to agree to those anti-free-rider terms.

    "golden_answer": " There are some major flaws in your reasoning, based on the way laws are written.  First and foremost, the law is written in such a manner that it favors the union  with regards to establishing a union shop.  Per the NLRB procedures, only 30% support is required to call an election, and only a majority vote is required to form the union, meaning that 50%-1 of workers for a company can be forced into union membership against their will (assuming no right-to-work law) or be forced to give up their job.  Secondly, unions are highly politically active groups, and tend to (as leadership and organizations) only be active on one side of the aisle, meaning that people are forced (if they want to work for a certain company) to donate money to organizations that will turn around and use that money to support candidates and causes that they don't support.   Finally, and most importantly, the pushback against unions is primarily a pushback against **public sector unions**, not private sector unions.  Even FDR, who may have done more for the labor movement than any other government official, knew that public sector unions were bad news.  >\"All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service,\" he wrote. \"It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management.\"  >Roosevelt didn’t stop there.  >\"The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations,\" he wrote.  >When Walker claimed FDR said \"the government is the people,\" he had Roosevelt’s next line in mind.  >\"The employer,\" Roosevelt’s letter added, \"is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters.\"   Roosevelt realized that the standard power dynamic between union and owner didn't apply. Its just not the same.  When the employees at Food Lion strike, you can go to another grocery store. If UAW strikes at Ford, someone is still making Chevys. But if the teachers strike, you can't just drop your kid off at St Catherine's for a couple weeks until it all blows over. If the Department of Sanitation strikes in NYC, there is no other option for dealing with trash.  Additionally, the political support side of it is even further amplified with public sector unions. Without RTW laws, a person cannot be a public servant, cannot teach children or fight fires or collect trash or deliver mail, without being forced to give a portion of their pay to a private organization that will in turn support politicians and policies that they may not agree with.  >On a side note, I'm genuinely puzzled why so many conservatives and libertarians support right to work laws despite those laws' undermining the freedom to contract.

But, the culture surrounding it, both inside clinical settings and on the internet, doesn't help people. It creates a culture of diagnosis, over actually helping people. It treats mental illness in a very medicalized way, when mental and physical illnesses shouldn't be viewed in the same way. They should be viewed with the same amount of respect. On the internet, specifically amongst teenagers, but not always, it becomes diagnosis olympics. I fell into this trap as a teenager, of becoming fascinated by what I could potentially have, as well as mental illnesses in general. Nothing wrong with that, looking into the mind is fascinating, but looking into it through that lens can lead to problems. It's not even people self-diagnosing that's necessarily the issue, cause sometimes people just know themselves, but rather viewing the mental illness as the explanation to all their problems. People behave as if these labels came before their actual experiences, when it's the opposite. Nothing really changes when you get diagnosed, people just feel comforted by it, because it is human nature to want to categorize things. I think a diagnosis can be helpful in understanding how to treat someone, and give them context into what's going on, but it's not the full picture by any means. In psychiatric hospitals, this is especially an issue, in which diagnosing people becomes the priority over actually helping them, so that people can be given meds, then sent away, since there's not enough space, and everyone is emotionally burnout (I know, that's a simplified view of what's going on).\n\nAssistant:",

What you’re describing sounds more like pathologizing human behavior. It’s typical for someone with a hammer to see a problem as a nail.

Some companies have played that game so well that they pay nothing in taxes, and a handful get a net positive payment. Which is dumb.  More generally, corporate taxes are sold as a \"tax on the rich\" but that's not how it works. When companies are taxed they raise prices as much as they can so it isn't the company that pays the tax. No, I pay that tax. Yeah, the company sends in the check but I'm the one out the money. If the company can't raise prices because we collectively won't put up with that then it's the workers who are turned down for raises or don't get hired or might get laid off. If companies can get away with some 'belt tightening' to make their earnings numbers look better to investors then you bet your ass that belt is tightening.  It's only when neither of those things are possible, when prices are as high as they are going to go and the belt is as tight as it's going to get, when the person paying the tax is the shareholders of the company. But are all shareholders rich? Well, once upon a time they were, but now some of the biggest shareholders around are the funds that pay out retirement and pensions. So, you hit retirees and current workers as much as you hit rich folks.  So, what tax does generally hit rich folks? Capital gains. Why? Because it's on the other side of the equation. It's taxing rich people directly where they can't shift its responsibility to anyone else. So, why is the Capital Gains rates lower? Well, there are two reasons. First is to encourage investment, a gentle nudge towards putting money to use instead of gold-filled swimming pools. And that does work... sorta... during specific parts of the business cycle. The other reason is a fairness argument. So, you make a dollar by owning a business, shrewd planning and a not insignificant amount of design work pays off. Only that $1 you made gets taxed 35% when it leaves the company and gets hit *again* when it enters your hand? Possibly as much as another 35% if we're using income tax brackets. Well, fuck that. The Federal government gets a full 70 cents on the dollar? And then States sometimes get another 15% and occasionally a city asks for 10%. So now, fuck. I got a whole shiny nickel out of that dollar I made. While unfairness should happen to rich folk every so often there's a point beyond which it's just dumb.  We would be better off if we taxed capital gains as income dropped the corporate tax altogether to take the boot off of the dollar store shopper a bit and stop the whole \"double tax bonus\" crazy train. It should even out revenue wise over the long run. But, we'd come out big ahead if we were to do something crazy like issue more grants to businesses starting in economically depressed areas and gave tax breaks to start ups instead of to the biggest companies in the world for their second or third headquarters."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Senior citizens should recieve even more love from people in Western culture Let me start with this: This is by no means a \"end all be all\" situation, every older person is a case by case basis. However, this is an issue I have with our general culture (mainly the US) that I think needs to be addressed.   For decades we have mocked the idea of old people in all types of media, decided older features are \"ugly\" and generally cast them aside. The general public seems indifferent at best to seniors to downright abusive. Greedy for their money in wills, willing to target their homes for robbery- even outright inciting violence against seniors. From The Simpson's Grandpa Abe to Family Guy's Herbert, we also end up treating them as creepy or just a drag to listen to (not to knock those shows, I love em myself).  I think we need to treat older people with more respect, because after all they were once our age. They once ran marathons, fought wars... They have so many stories to share and HISTORY to contribute. To treat them as second class is downright awful. I'm not arguing every old person is a saint, but I can't get over that someone as sweet as my own great grandma is the target of harassment and scams. That she's seen as ugly just for being 83. We're so eager to cut their programs and go \"Cut grandpa's life support, he's not gonna live long anyways\".\n\nAssistant:",

    "golden_answer": " Every time Spiderman is out of his element, it's reflected accordingly. But all Spiderman really needs for his mobility is tall stuff - that can be trees, or any city with tall buildings. Plenty of cities have tall buildings, even a wide span of dense tall buildings. Indeed, some cities are taller and larger!  I think Spiderman is so keyed to NYC because it's part of his character. But there are plenty of Spiderman stories where he's out of NYC (and indeed, being out of NYC is part of his reflection of the experience!). But a lot of characters are similarly keyed to cities - Daredevil to NYC (just a different neighborhood really!), Batman to Gotham, Superman to Metropolis. I grant that Superman can OPERATE anywhere, but part of who the character is, is keyed to being a mild mannered reporter in the City of Cities.  So I think it's kind of a flexible situation. In terms of execution of their powers though, think about how many supers have this issue - Flash for example operates in cities all the time, which seems like a terrible idea for someone who needs open straight aways.

I have seen a lot lot of backlash against women in the Women's March who carry signs relating to their pussy (such as \"Stay Out of My Pussy\") and wear pink pussy hats. (I personally find pink pussy hats silly but that is neither here nor there). The backlash has been in the form of fb statuses, tweets, and think pieces that claim that talking about a pussy as a part of your experience of womanhood is trans exclusionary.  While I agree that not all woman have vaginas and not all people with vaginas are women I don't think it is fair to tell someone that what makes them personally feel like a woman is false. Every woman has different things that make them connect with the idea of being a woman (some are choices and some aren't). Some women feel that their long hair makes them feel womanly while some women with short hair say their short hair brings out their feminine features. Same can be said for wearing make up or not. When it comes to bodies some women with thin waistlines say that makes them feel like a woman while some women with curves feel like their curves are part of their womanly identity.   I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman feeling like her pussy or the fact that she can give birth is part of what makes her feel connected to the word woman as long as she recognizes that not all women have vaginas or the ability to give birth and they are still just as much of a woman as she is. After all I have heard from some trans women that their penis feels like part of their personal womanhood and that is acceptable too.  It is impossible to connect all women with a single trait other than their shared identity of describing themselves as women. Why can't having a vagina, which is a trait shared by 99% of women, be an acceptable thing to connect with other women about?   The female reproductive system is treated unfairly by the government. Saying that doesn't mean I don't agree that healthcare for trans women (and men) is also unjust. This backlash feels like their saying \"the injustices of my group are worse than yours therefore your injustices shouldn't be fought for.\"  I think it is important for feminism to be intersectional, I just also think is is ok to accept that everyone identifies the way they do for their own specific and personal reasons. Doing so doesn't mean they don't accept you for having your own different or even contradictory personal reasons for sharing that label.

    "golden_answer": " I'm not sure exactly what you mean. I could say to myself, \"I feel like a man when I eat Cheerios every day,\" and that's fine. I might genuinely have something inside of me that provides a sense of belonging and association with being male whenever I eat Cheerios. Who cares. Am I saying that I think other men who don't eat Cheerios are not \"real\" men? Nope, I just feel like a man when I eat them. And that may also imply that I feel like less of a man if I don't eat them.  But what if almost *everyone* on earth associated eating Cheerios with being a man, even the women? And then I come along, and I just don't like the taste of Cheerios. Because the association between Cheerios and manhood is so widespread, people will also assume the opposite: if you *don't* eat Cheerios, you are not a real man.  In your example, if an individual woman is just saying that as a simply personal statement, then you're correct. She can experience a sense of belonging to her gender because of her sex. I don't think feeling that way is wrong, it actually seems pretty rational to me. And it doesn't necessarily imply that she also thinks \"Not having a vagina is not feminine\". But when an overwhelming portion of a modern society feels a certain way, that feeling / belief system becomes part of society, and creates exclusion of people who do not feel that same way. It becomes a truth in society.  A woman who thinks this way is implicitly saying that her gender (\"I feel like a woman\") is directly tied to her biological sex (\"I have a vagina / female sex organs\"), which is objectively trans-exclusive, *especially* because that usually means \"If I didn't have a vagina, I would feel like less of a woman,\" and *especially* when it is the majority view.  This doesn't necessarily mean that trans people are offended by this idea, by the way. I can't really speak much towards that."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: We only think Tupac and Biggie were the best rappers of all time because they died so young My argument is basically that Tupac and Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) are only thought of as the GOATs because of the aura surrounding them. They are thought of as almost beyond reproach because they died so young and had the famous rap feud.  If Nas died after *It Was Written* he would be considered the GOAT. If Eminem died after *The Marshall Mathers LP* or *The Eminem Show* he would be definitively considered the GOAT. If Kanye died after *Graduation* or *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* he would be considered the GOAT.  Alternatively, If Nas and Jay-Z both died during their famous rap feud, they would be elevated similar to Pac and Big. Same could be said for 50 and Ja Rule.  I could go on all day, but my point is that because these artists kept putting out music (some of which has been considered lackluster), they damaged their reputation as the GOAT in a way Tupac and Big never really had a chance to do. Arguably, Tupac came close to damaging his reputation with all his posthumous releases, but, more people would need to know about his posthumous releases for it to have a significant impact.  Furthermore, the rap feuds bring in more outside attention from the entertainment world. Thus the layman is able to identify Pac and Big as the GOATs because they are simply the most recognizable/most well known rappers of all time not necessarily the best.  If Mac Miller didn’t make as much frat rap/corny music coming up, he might in the conversation right now. You see the GOAT label unironically placed on XxXtentacion by his fans, although I’m prepared to admit that is a vocal minority.  In reality Tupac and Big were NOT significantly more talented than others of that era—A Tribe Called Quest, The Fugees, NWA and its members, Snoop, Nas, Big Daddy Kane, Eric B and Rakim, OutKast, Jay-Z and Wu Tang are all arguably just as talented and that’s only scratching the surface. Biggie had an amazing style and crazy flows, Pac had grit and passion. They were both great writers. But are they the greatest of all time?

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The Next 50 Years of Humanity Will Be Better Than the Previous 50 Years Nowadays, it's a pretty common opinion among younger millennials that the world is, to put it gently, fucked. Many of them hold the view that climate change will soon cause an irreversible decline in quality of life. Capitalism will continue to serve the interests of the rich and powerful while making it increasingly difficult for the lower and middle classes to afford life's necessities. And it will be nearly impossible, not to mention immoral, to raise and start a family in this messed up, increasingly unjust world.  I believe these naysayers have it backwards. Humanity is constantly progressing, and the next 50 years will be better—perhaps much better—than the last 50 years.   First, a few notes:  * As an American, I apologize for my primarily American-centric point of view. I believe my points generally hold true for humanity as a whole, but I am most knowledgeable about how these issues are playing out in American life, so I will primarily view them through that lens. * I am progressive/center-left in my politics. As my post is generally replying to the views of *other* progressives, it assumes that progressive policies are a good thing, and that, for the most part, the more progressive the policy the better. It's totally reasonable to disagree with my view on this, but I'm not really here to engage in a political debate of Left vs. Right. * How can you change my view? Just give me a solid argument that there's a significant likelihood of the next 50 years *not* being as good as the last 50. To do this, you should probably explain either (a) why I am wrong about the beneficial trends listed below, (b) why these trends are likely to reverse in the next 50 years, or (c) why these trends, good as they are, simply don't tell the whole story, and that other factors are simply bad enough to outweigh these positive trends.  Here are the five primary reasons for my view:  (1) **Social Progress.** Humanity's continuing social progress is undeniable. In the modern era, each succeeding generation has been more tolerant and accepting than the one before. Racial bigotry is still an enormous problem in our society, but it has been in rapid decline since the 1960s. Movements such as Black Lives Matter are gaining increasing acceptance, so much that they have now become mainstream (e.g., the George Floyd protests occurred nationwide, as opposed to being contained to a specific community). We scrutinize racial discrimination moreso today than at any point in history. No longer are we only concerned with *de jure* discrimination, but we examine and prosecute instances of *de facto* discrimination with increasing zealousness. Terms such as \"implicit\" and \"systemic\" racism are used by everyday people, which is certainly not the case in the past. Affirmative action has become a routine college admissions practice, and more and more people of color are being elected or appointed to political office.  This progress is not limited to racial issues. The LGBTQ+ movement has won widespread acceptance in at least some of its goals. Today, a same-sex couple has a constitutional right to marriage in all 50 of the United States. What's more, this sweeping change has been largely accepted by the vast swath of society—conservatives really no longer seriously contest this point. Mental health is no longer as much of a taboo and a stigma as it once was, and therapy is becoming normalized. Legal access to medical and recreational marijuana, among other drugs, is increasing each year. The #MeToo Movement has shed light on sexual assault and harassment in a way never seen before, holding many powerful men to account for perhaps the first time in their lives. Access to an abortion remains a constitutionally protected right, despite some attempts to limit or dismantle it, and the Democratic Party has becoming increasingly interested in ensuring legal access to abortions.  It's undeniable that the world of 2021 is a much more socially progressive place than the world of 1971. It seems inconceivable that this trend would not continue over the next 50 years, especially as younger generations age up and older generations, which often hold less-progressive social views, gradually die out.  (2) **Scientific and Medical Progress.** The COVID pandemic wrought unspeakable hardship on society, but it could have been so much worse if not for the miracle of modern medicine. We were able to quickly develop and approve a slate of vaccines to fight the disease. Today, little more than a year after the pandemic began in the United States, we now have more than 30% of the population with at least one dose of the vaccine, with millions more being vaccinated per day. This is a far cry from the unstoppable terrors of past pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu, which society simply had to wait out until the virus eventually \"burned itself out\" from the vast amounts of death and infection.  Modern medicine has allowed people today to live longer, healthier, more productive, and happier lives than at any point in human history.  We will continue to expand the mRNA technology used to develop some of the COVID vaccines. We will continue to pour billions of dollars into researching treatments for other diseases, such as cancer. We will continue to get better and better at fighting disease and pain. Science is amazing, and it will only continue to amaze us in the years to come.  (3) **Political Progress.** This point overlaps a bit with Point (1). Politicians today care more about equality and equity than those of generations past. Leftist ideas, like Medicare for All, free college, and the Green New Deal, would have been anathema just a few decades ago. Now they are supported by increasing numbers of Americans. The Overton Window is shifting, and it's shifting in a much more progressive direction. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he did not support a nationwide right to same-sex marriage. But in 2020, Joe Biden—a seemingly more middle-of-the-road politician—does. Biden also supports a $15 minimum wage as well as enormous expansions of the welfare state and government programs in general.   With each new generation, ambitious progressive policies become increasingly attainable. At some point in the next 50 years, the United States will almost certainly have a more equitable and affordable healthcare system than it does today. It's really only a matter of time.   What's more, large scale wars have become a thing of the past. Because of (1) nuclear proliferation and mutually-assured destruction, (2) the increasing interconnectedness of global trade, and (3) American and NATO military supremacy, large nations just don't feel like fighting as many wars as they did in generations past. Combat deaths are decreasing, and so too are violent crime statistics. Despite a recent uptick during the pandemic, violent crime has been steadily decreasing throughout the United States with each passing decade. The upshot of all of this is that you are much less likely to die by violent means today than at any point in history. These trends will continue, and death by violence will be even more rare in 2071 than it is today.  (4) **Economic Progress.** Capitalism certainly has its downsides. It has made the rich even richer. But it has also made life much more affordable for the poor and downtrodden. Capitalism allows the formation of corporations of an enormous scale, like Amazon and Wal-Mart. These corporations are successful because they are able to undercut the prices of their competitors. Wal-Mart prices are dirt cheap, and their stores are found in many places across the United States, including in much poorer and/or rural communities that simply couldn't support a more expensive retailer like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or Jewel-Osco. Yes, economies of scale make the people at the top much richer than they would otherwise be. But they serve enormous, and underrated, benefits to those with less means.  Additionally, capitalism has allowed the mass production of food the likes of which the world has never seen. Child hunger is in free fall. Industrialization is putting the worldwide poverty rate in freefall, as well. This process will only continue over the next 50 years, cutting poverty and hunger rates even further.  (5) **Overstating the Dangers Humanity Faces**. Now, to address climate change. Climate change is real, and its consequences are downright scary. But it is not the existential threat that those on the far left make it out to be. It is an enormous problem that will make life more difficult for many. But it is a problem that we can ameliorate to an extent that it does not severely threaten the quality of life of most people, even if we cannot entirely prevent it from occurring.  We're already seeing signs of this. The Paris Climate Accords of 2016 are a monument to how seriously world leaders are taking the issue, and how eager they are to fashion political solutions. Yes, the U.S. did briefly leave the Accords under the Trump administration, but the U.S. quickly re-entered under Biden.   Moreover, capitalism, the foe that made climate change as much of a threat as it is today, may actually save us from the monster it created. Green energy is becoming more and more profitable. Companies in various industries see a profit-making opportunity, and they are jumping on it. Car manufacturers are building more and more electric vehicles. More and more wind farms and solar panels are being constructed each and every year. The number of people employed in the \"green energy\" sector dwarfs the number employed in the fossil fuel industry. The transition away from oil is already well underway.  And even *if* we do no more to stop climate change than we are currently doing, I would argue that points (1) through (4) *still* outweigh any of the quality-of-life harms that climate change will cause in the next 50 years.   \\--------  In conclusion, I believe the next 50 years will proceed much as the last 50 years have, with humanity continuing its long history of gradual progress into a more beneficent worldwide community. The next 50 years will be better than the last 50 years. CMV.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Well, \"better\" is a matter of perspective. I will assume you mean better in terms of a higher standard of living for the average person, with fewer major issues such as war, racism, economic crisis, environmental catastrophe, etc.  My opinion is that the next 50 years *could* be better, but only with a radical restructuring of the economy, which will likely take several revolutions. Given the fact that such a revolution is not on the horizon any time soon, I think it's most likely that the \"naysayers\" as you put it will turn out to be correct.  Now to respond to your points:  Point 1:  > It's undeniable that the world of 2021 is a much more socially progressive place than the world of 1971. It seems inconceivable that this trend would not continue over the next 50 years, especially as younger generations age up and older generations, which often hold less-progressive social views, gradually die out.   What do you make of the nascent fascist movement in the US? At the moment, they aren't very organized and have essentially zero chance at getting near the halls of power. But many legislators are now practically open fascists (Marjorie Taylor Greene), and the conditions which created them (failure of the Left, neoliberal austerity, economic crisis) have not really gone away. If the fascists get into power, you can bet that all of this social progress will be gone.  Furthermore, the most recent recession has disproportionately impacted women and is likely to reinforce gender norms which previously were considered outdated. Women with partners who make enough money will likely be forced to stay home. Poorer women and women of color will likely be forced to do double duty caring for children and working simultaneously.  Furthermore, abortion is becoming more and more difficult to access: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/report-details-wave-state-legislative-attempts-restrict-abortion-2021-n1262070. This trend is likely to intensify over time as the fight over child-rearing and who will pay for it intensifies.  Point 2:  > Modern medicine has allowed people today to live longer, healthier, more productive, and happier lives than at any point in human history.   Life expectancy is trending downward in the USA: https://www.businessinsider.com/us-life-expectancy-declined-for-third-year-in-a-row-2019-11  Science and medicine certainly can help people live better and longer lives, but it doesn't guarantee that. Current levels of wealth and income inequality are likely to make accessing decent medical care more and more difficult. Furthermore, the lack of decently paying jobs and stable housing is likely to shorten more people's lives despite any advances in medical care.  Furthermore, while the world might have handled this pandemic relatively well compared with the Spanish flu, it did extremely poorly in comparison to what it could have. For most governments across the West in particular, it was more important for people to continue to work and make profits for the corporations than it was to save people's lives.  Finally, a point that doesn't get mentioned very often is that this pandemic is actually a result of capitalism. Agribusiness destroys biodiversity, puts humans in contact with animals they never were before, and lines up hoards of genetically similar creatures next to each other. In other words, they create the ideal conditions for virulent and deadly pandemics. Current society has no way of addressing the root causes of this crisis.  To learn more, you can read https://www.amazon.com/Big-Farms-Make-Flu-Agribusiness/dp/1583675892.  Point 3:  > Politicians today care more about equality and equity than those of generations past. Leftist ideas, like Medicare for All, free college, and the Green New Deal, would have been anathema just a few decades ago.   This is similar to the era of the New Deal, actually. Outside of the U.S., everything except the Green New Deal has been achieved in generations past. How is this progress?  > What's more, large scale wars have become a thing of the past. Because of (1) nuclear proliferation and mutually-assured destruction, (2) the increasing interconnectedness of global trade, and (3) American and NATO military supremacy, large nations just don't feel like fighting as many wars as they did in generations past.   No one ever wants war. It just becomes inevitable. Leaders need to \"look tough\" to their populace. Competing businesses and powers demand access to other nations' resources, and refuse to back down. Both sides think the other will back down if they just push a little harder, but they never do. Eventually everyone finds themselves in full-scale war. And all of this happens despite each side knowing the enormous cost.  Point 4:  > But it has also made life much more affordable for the poor and downtrodden.   No, it hasn't. Education, housing, and medical care have all become more expensive since the 1970s. More people are unhoused now than at any point aside from the Great Depression. Even food prices are starting to rise.  Point 5:  > Moreover, capitalism, the foe that made climate change as much of a threat as it is today, may actually save us from the monster it created. Green energy is becoming more and more profitable. Companies in various industries see a profit-making opportunity, and they are jumping on it. Car manufacturers are building more and more electric vehicles. More and more wind farms and solar panels are being constructed each and every year. The number of people employed in the \"green energy\" sector dwarfs the number employed in the fossil fuel industry. The transition away from oil is already well underway.   \"Green energy\" is mostly a myth. There is no form of energy that does not cause environmental devastation at the scale required to sustain current energy demand. See https://e360.yale.edu/features/boom\\_in\\_mining\\_rare\\_earths\\_poses\\_mounting\\_toxic\\_risks#:\\~:text=A%20half%20century%20of%20rare,with%20a%20%E2%80%9Chigh%20concentration%E2%80%9D%20of for more information.  Capitalist firms have always destroyed the environment. They consider environmental degradation to be an externality. This is because they are in competition with each other for profits, and anyone who spares extra change for the environment will lose out. This is true even considering state regulation; different states are in competition with each other for their share of the global market. They won't pass any legislation that would imperil their share of the global market, even though it is precisely this legislation that is required to prevent catastrophe.  Our soil is degrading, disastrous storms are now commonplace, our food and water supply is contaminated with plastic permanently, the coral reefs are dying and most governments and corporations are still doing everything they can to make it worse. If climate change doesn't kill us, there's a long line of contenders willing to give it a shot.  \\---  I am not trying to be pessimistic. We can always try to make things better. The movements for climate justice, racial justice, etc. are promising and give me hope for a better future.  But putting our heads in the sand or thinking that things will turn out OK despite everything is counterproductive. We have to see the ugly truth if we want to make things better."

Not to mention that Clinton's approval rating was boosted by impeachment. If Dems somehow were able to impeach Trump, they would be blamed by the right, proclaiming the Democrats are trying to sabotage conservative solutions before they even had a chance to be tried.

The issue is that *he is a goddamn child occupying the most powerful position on earth*. Yes, Pence has more mainstream appeal, and will probably be even more effective at pushing the Republican party line. He's also an adult with experience in government and is much less inclined to shoot from the hip on matters of life and death.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I think the 'culture' around alcohol is extremely toxic and needs to be fixed. CMV To start of, I realize how difficult of an issue this is. Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up.   My background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool.   This is not rare. Especially villages have the risk of getting into extreme alcoholism and though I know I live in one of the worst places when it come to this issue (I have actually looked at statistics), I think it does highlight in a hyperbolic way how toxic the culture we live in can be to many people. Having grown up with an alcoholic has made me very sensitive to the signs of alcoholism and I recognize it a lot easier than most. My offers of help would be dismissed and ridiculed.  People who don't drink are called 'straight-edge', but not in a good way. I have made my own conscious decision to not drink, because doing so would be triggering to me. I couldn't hang around people who drink or casually go to a party without it being forced on me. I have had people get legitimately angry at me for not drinking. I 'spoil the fun', I'm prude and I'm boring. I am apparently not allowed to have fun without getting drunk.  I think every one of you at least knows someone who has a problem with alcohol and maybe even had it themselves. In how many of those cases did these people have to get into an accident, have to go through something horrible before they would get help?  In my opinion, the way we glorify alcohol in the media contributes to how hard it is for these people to get help. Commercials for alcohol are full of objectification of women and machismo. They target people who naively buy into the image of the charming man who is succesful with women. Drinking away problems is almost encouraged in some cases. I am not completely against any positive portrayal of alcohol, but I think there's a great lack of nuance.  Having said all that, I am still open to opposing views and hope to see if anyone has any information I'm missing that might get me to change my view.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Having worked in the substance abuse prevention field with remote villages in the past, I'd say that the bigger problem is village life, not alcohol glorification. I think you're focusing your efforts in the wrong place. Not so long ago, villages needed everyone to contribute in order for the village to survive. Now, that's not the case and there's nothing for most people to do. I've been to places where anything in an aerosol can had to be kept behind the counter at the store and not sold to minors because kids were so desperate for an escape that they'd huff whatever they could get their hands on. Alcohol is just another escape, just like any other drug.   You're never going to be able to change how alcohol is portrayed in popular culture, so you need to counteract it with messages that it isn't necessary or good for you. More importantly, though, you need to find something for people to do so they don't feel the need to turn to substance use in the first place."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The current US bailouts for all the large companies is unfair to both the US taxpayers, small businesses, and every company that responsibly managed their money in recent years Recently, the US government has given out trillions in bailouts to the airline, retail, hospitality, etc industries. However, as a tax payer, I'm outraged that these large corporations are getting these handouts from the government and getting rewarded for their greedy behavior. The bank bailouts of 08 made me sick and I can't believe we're doing this again. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes due to the bank's irresponsible and illegal behavior, and yet all these bankers made out with millions.  Take the airline industry for example. 96% of their Free Cash Flow was spent on stock buybacks this past decade. These C-suite executives and investors made millions off this type of behavior despite not creating any type of value for both the company and for their employees. If your company can't last a few months of stagnant revenue, you shouldn't be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends. Especially when a large reason these companies found so much excess money in the last couple years was an egregious gifted tax cut from the government. Sure no one could have foreseen the current environment, but nearly every economist was predicting a recession within the next few years. They should have prepared for some type of downturn.   Furthermore, this punishes the companies that actually acted responsibly with their capital. In normal circumstances, this would be their opportunity to gain market share and even buy up some of the failing companies. Instead, they are robbed of this opportunity. The way our market works is that feedback is all seen through the lens of risk and reward. When a company decides to spend almost all of their profits on buybacks, they are taking the risk that a black swan event in the future can cause bankruptcy. Now we are removing the incentive for prudent decision making for companies. What's to stop companies of only acting recklessly since they know the government will always bail them out?  Lastly, lots of small businesses are going bankrupt everyday. Where are their bailouts? Why should large companies with every advantage in the world be given this lifeline for acting so irresponsibly, when normal everyday people struggling to get by are not allotted this same opportunity.  Before anyone says it, I understand bailouts are not free money. They're a loan by the government. But the interest rates are typically much lower than they would command in the free market. The government should either charge a high interest rate to compensate for that risk, or inject money into these companies through equity investments that could be put in a blind trust. At least in this scenario, the bailout is seen through the lens of a prudent investment. It's also pricing in the risks of investing in these companies since we never know what will happen to them in the future. If they don't want it, they can find someone else to give them money or go bankrupt. It's not like these companies will just disappear, there will be a buyer somewhere out there.   No one is ENTITLED to a low interest loan from the government, especially these mega corporations who barely pay above minimum wage for their lowest employees while constantly upping the C-suite's compensation. By handing out bailouts that actually reflect the risk for these companies, we can actually punish the C-Suite and investors who squeezed every bit of profit out of the company during good times since these deals will negatively affect the stock price. The bailouts in its current form reward the CEOs and investors who already cashed out in the past couple of years pushing for buybacks and increased dividends.\n\nAssistant:",

Houses in most major metros where most of the U.S. population lives, housing prices are increasing at rates faster than what incomes can keep up with. This is causing a lot of financial hardship; especially among young workers and working class people, to the point it is locking out an entire generation and class of people out of home ownership. Furthermore, I only see overwhelming incentives to keep prices high, and for those prices to keep increasing. I don't think I'll ever be able to afford a house in my lifetime, or at least not for a few decades. Here are the reasons why  1. Rich Foreign buyers are buying up property and out competing people who reside in local economies 2. Real Estate Investment Trusts and Big Banks within the U.S. are also out competing people residing in local economies 3. Older Generations are opposing any and all forms of urban density that would increase housing supply in a meaningful amount to lower prices. 4. The U.S. Population keeps increasing; but the land the U.S. has is finite. Most land that is easily assessable to most people living in urban centers is already developed. 5. Wages continue to stagnate despite increased housing costs; furthering the gap. 6. Materials to build homes and laws/regulations for lot sizes make it expensive to build homes; therefore the homes and condos being built are \"luxury\" properties.

I'll preface with this: yes, gender equality would mean treating genders equally, so men shouldn't view women as weaker or treat them differently because of gender. So yeah, the whole \"you shouldn't fight a girl because she's a girl\" logic is inherently sexist. So I don't disagree with the fact that gender equality means throwing that whole idea out.  &#x200B;  However...  &#x200B;  If your very first thought is to use gender equality as a justification for violence against women, you're most likely misogynistic, or maybe you're just trying to crack a really annoying overused joke, idk. When I think of feminism, I think of equality in opportunities - in the eyes of the law, in healthcare, in sports, in the job market, in education, in STEM fields and so on; my very first thought isn't \"oOo so that means men should be allowed to hit girls!\" Like why are your thoughts on feminism immediately connected to what men can do because of feminism? Why is your first instinct violence against women instead of considering how much more positive women's lives can be as gender equality improves? Why is feminism seen as a justification for doing more wrong?   &#x200B;  Feminism should focus on lifting women up so that they are on equal footing as men and get the same treatment and opportunities as men get. So why are you immediately resorting to the new opportunities men can get as feminism develops? Also, yes you can theoretically fight women like you would men, but I feel like with the men who don't understand feminism well, they're going to take this as \"I'm allowed to hit women\" when in reality the notion should only apply to situations like fighting in self-defense. Some people are definitely going to take gender equality as \"men are \\*allowed\\* to fight women\" instead of \"men should not be held back from violence against any gender if they are in a situation of self-defense or where violence is necessary.\"   &#x200B;  Again, I agree that saying things like \"I don't fight women,\" \"I can't hit her because she's a girl,\" etc. are sexist; they are. But, if the first thing you think of when you think of gender equality is hitting women, out of all things that could change because of feminism...you got problems.  &#x200B;  Sorry in advance if any explanation was unclear, I kinda suck at writing out arguments.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Liberal Americans are justified to be angry with Trump supporters and to worry about the future Since the election, there's been various statistics showing that liberals are more pessimistic about the country's future and dislike Trump and many of his supporters. Since the shooting last month (iirc), it's become popular (and easy) to say that liberals should be nicer and more open minded but I believe they would be naive not to worry about Republicans and very passive not to be angry with Republican voters.  Firstly, Republicans have disproportionately high political power. Due to them living in smaller States and rural areas, their votes matter more than those in cities and states like California or New York in the Senate and presidential elections. This means they can impose their ideas on the majority of people even if they are unpopular among the majority (e.g. Trump). This is undemocratic and worrying given their behaviour.  Second, Republicans policies and politicians are genuinely dangerous. Republican policies on health care and government support will almost certainly hurt people and even cost lives. Most political parties wouldn't consider policies as extreme as theirs but they are special in how far right wing they are. Their indifference to climate change, poverty, poor healthcare and inequality means that their policies will actually make America and the world worse. It'd be stupid for liberals to be ok with this. Plus despite Obamacare disproportionately helping Trump supporters, they still want it dismantled just because they see it as a 'win'. How can you not fear someone who hates you so much, they're willing to suffer just to 'beat' you?  Also, Trump and many other Republican politicians show erratic and/or ammoral behaviour that should be concerning to people. Even mainstream Republicans like McConnel regularly behave appallingly.  Thirdly, Republicans cannot be reasoned with. As can be seen by their contempt for higher education, the CBO, media, science and economics, Republicans don't see truth as objective. They believe it is simply a matter of opinion and anyone or anything which says they're wrong must be biased because there's no way they can actually be wrong. Because of this Republicans will enact policies that are dangerous without any concern for the consequences for the future or even themselves. This erratic behaviour makes them frustrating at best and dangers to themselves and others at worst. Simply put, Republicans could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems. In many ways, Trump personifies the GOP better than John McCain or Mitt Romney ever could because of his combination of ignorance and arrogance.  Finally, they lack respect and compassion for others. As can be seen from policies like gerrymandering and voter suppression, tactics like the obstruction from the GOP on things like the Supreme Court and just their general behaviour like the nomination of Trump who is basically a prejudiced bully, Republicans seem more motivated by a need to beat liberals and to control America than any desire for self improvement or any moral concerns. Their indifference to problems like racism, sexism and homophobia should anger liberals. Also their lack of concern for police shootings or sexual assault and their contempt for abortion makes them a genuine danger to women and minorities. Their priority seems to be to preserve a social order in which they have their values imposed on those they view to be inferior (e.g. women, minorities, the poor, LGBT) even if it's at their own expense.  So am I wrong about how bad Republicans are or should liberals not fear them because Republicans will quickly lose power?  _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

You might say there's no difference between not helping and hurting, but then you will open the Pandora's Box of morality and start down a very slippery slope. Every dollar that you spend on a luxury like coffee, Coca Cola, Snickers, or Netflix suddenly becomes a dollar you could have donated to someone else in much greater need of food or shelter.  > Their indifference to climate change, poverty, poor healthcare and inequality means that their policies will actually make America and the world worse. It'd be stupid for liberals to be ok with this. Plus despite Obamacare disproportionately helping Trump supporters, they still want it dismantled just because they see it as a 'win'.  This is where I think the narrative that's being perpetuated goes too far. Are there self-serving politicians that are completely indifferent to the well-being of their fellow man? Yep. And guess what, they exist on both sides of the aisle, regardless of whether they have a (R) or a (D) in front of their name. But the average person working in Washington probably *does* care about the well-being of people and the country, it's just that they disagree on the best solution.   For example, yes, many of the most ardent Trump supporters are also simultaneously the recipients of the greatest amount of aid they don't want. But you should also try and look at it from their perspective. They don't *want* handouts, they would rather have a job and buy their own health insurance.   > Also, Trump and many other Republican politicians show erratic and/or ammoral behaviour that should be concerning to people. Even mainstream Republicans like McConnel regularly behave appallingly.  I would caution against using \"amoral\" as a litmus for people, because that is entirely subjective and you are literally measuring them using morality, which varies from person to person. Legal and ethical are the proper metrics here, not moral.   > Thirdly, Republicans cannot be reasoned with. As can be seen by their contempt for higher education, the CBO, media, science and economics, Republicans don't see truth as objective. They believe it is simply a matter of opinion and anyone or anything which says they're wrong must be biased because there's no way they can actually be wrong.  In all honestly, I will say this: Republican legislators often have a more realistic outlook as opposed to Democrats who are at times blinded by idealism. For example, dumping more money into education won't produce any results when we already lead in spending per student. We already spend plenty, it's just that costs are ramping up to match spending (look at college tuition or $78 doorknobs and $300 office chairs.)  College is also not a panacea that will solve all our problems. Degree inflation is absolutely real, look at European countries and you will get an idea of how needlessly inflated educational attainment can become without increase in value from the education itself. Instead of herding people into college classrooms and having taxpayers foot the bill, education should be fixed at the K-12 level.  It's easy to pitch free college as the answer to student loans. It's hard to admit that people have to make choices in their life and be responsible for the choices they make. It's also equally hard to figure out a fair and equitable way to pay for the education through tax dollars.   > Because of this Republicans will enact policies that are dangerous without any concern for the consequences for the future or even themselves. This erratic behaviour makes them frustrating at best and dangers to themselves and others at worst. Simply put, Republicans could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems.   Again, drummed up narrative. People could view the unsustainable levels of spending as dangerous and be concerned for the consequences of adding to the national debt, censoring of their freedom of speech, and growing scope of the federal government and the Executive branch through Executive Orders. \" Simply put, Democrats could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems as long as they say it's to help people. \"  Finally, they lack respect and compassion for others.   > This is where I think /u/Metallic52 hits the nail on the head. Just because they do not show compassion the same way you do does not mean they are devoid of it.   As can be seen from policies like gerrymandering and voter suppression,  Both parties engage in gerrymandering, the Republicans are simply better at it. This doesn't justify the practice, but it is allowed and will continue to be done unless reform is enacted. As for voter suppression, there is a distinction that needs to be made here about disparate impact versus disparate intent. For example a fair and neutral law could end up disparately impacting a group more than others, but that is because of the circumstances of the impacted group and not on the law itself. For example, Voter ID's themselves are a perfectly fine reasonable requirement. However, it is polarized because it would result in disparate impact. Because you can not create a neutral impact law, often times it's best to just go for neutral intent and deal with the impact.   > Their indifference to problems like racism, sexism and homophobia should anger liberals. Also their lack of concern for police shootings or sexual assault and their contempt for abortion makes them a genuine danger to women and minorities. Their priority seems to be to preserve a social order in which they have their values imposed on those they view to be inferior even if it's at their own expense.  This is the part where I feel like the liberals drove themselves off the cliff. Instead of slowing down and acknowledging the progress made and using realistic language, many just doubled-down, slammed on the gas, and dialed it up to 11 on many issues. For example, expanding the definition of what constitutes as sexual-assault, cherry-picking statistics and not controlling for variables for wages, and blanket protection of any police victims instead of judging them on a case-by-case basis.   The hardest part for many ardent liberals to come to terms with is that feelings =/= facts. Just because you feel discriminated against, doesn't mean you were. Are there crazy religious ladies in Kansas that are abusing their positions as a civil servant? You betcha. But not every case is like that, and you'll have your crazies both to the left and right. There's a SJW and Feminazi like Anita Sarkeesian that is rabid with dogma for every Kim Davis. Most people are more towards the center.  > So am I wrong about how bad Republicans are or should liberals not fear them because Republicans will quickly lose power?  This is not to attack you or make a slight against your character, but I think you need to be more tolerant and empathetic towards people you don't agree with. Oftentimes Conservatives just look and live life differently than you or I do, and you have to be alright with that. They can view it as a personal choice whether or not to bake a cake for someone. They can disagree with you on what is best for the economy and helping lift people out of poverty. They can and probably will think that border security is more important than healthcare as a federal issue, but might be inclined to flip that around at the State level.   I've repeated it multiple times, but I want to reiterate it to emphasize on how important it is: Don't get caught up in the narratives. It's extremely easy to demonize, nay, dehumanize people as racists, bigots, homophobes, and devalue their opinions as human beings. It's even easier in this day and age for the worst of the worst to be propelled to top of the internet and used as strawmen examples by each side. But it's imperative that everyone steps back once in a while and realize that we aren't as malicious and hateful as the echo chamber and distorted headlines make each other out to be.   We're all just human. And as humans, we're different. It's not just about tolerating each other racially, ethnically, sexually, but also ideologically."

I believe that people who think this is a convincing argument should also believe that a person's right to survive by receiving a new organ is more important than people's right to decide what happens to their own body after their brain death.   Both arguments have a very similar structure.  (Personally, I am pro-choice and don't believe that organ donations should be mandatory although I am willing to donate my organs if that should be possible after my death.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I think your argument misses the importance that pro-lifers place on individual responsibility. Many people believe that a pregnant mother who conceives a healthy, unborn child via consensual intercourse has implicitly accepted the responsibility to carry that child to term (barring any serious medical complications). It's not just about the value of the unborn life--it's about the mother's choice to deal with the natural consequences of sexual intercourse. A pro-lifer may believe that a child in utero has some entitlement to the support of a woman's body because the woman voluntarily partcipated in the child's conception. I believe this is the same ethical justification that the State uses to justify garnering an absentee father's wages for child support: the fact that he doesn't want to pay for the child's expenses is irrelevant in the face of his responsibility to it.  This same direct relationship of obligation does not exist between a potential organ donor and organ recipient. Especially when we're discussing the recently deceased, the relation between donor and recipient is purely incidental."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Affirmative Action for college admissions should be based on socioeconimic status, and not race. Title. I'll use myself as an example to start. I'm Lumbee Indian (card-carrying), and thus college is free for me from many instutions.   The issue arises from the fact that I don't live in Robeson County, North Carolina, where much of my family does, and where the Lumbee tend to be poorer than white people, on average. I live in Minnesota, am moderately well-off, and have never faced racial discrimination, (mostly because my dad is white and I got his genes.)  But I still get free college, despite my grades being average at best.   This is why I believe that college admissions shouldn't look at you're race, but at the wealth of your family. Race doesn't generally cause people to get poor grades and test scores, but the wealth of their parents can.   A white kid with a single mother who works as a janitor, but has a 3.8 GOA and a 30 on the ACT would be more qualified for university than Malia Obama, if she had the same numbers.  Race can be a factor, but it isn't always a factor, and colleges should recognize that.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " You seem to misunderstand the goal and history of affirmative action. That's okay. Most people do.   The goal is not to create a level playing field. The goal is not to 're-correct' for prejudice. The goal is not even to benefit the \"recipients\" of affirmative action.   **The goal of affirmative action is desegregation**  Brown Vs. Board of Ed. found that separate but equal never was equal. If that's true, what do we do about defacto separation due to segregation? We need to have future generations of CEOs, judges and teachers who represent 'underrepresented' minorities.   What we ended up having to do was bussing, and AA.  Bussing is moving minorities from segregated neighborhoods into white schools. The idea is for white people to see black faces and the diversity that similar appearance can hide. Seeing that some blacks are Americans and some are Africans would be an important part of desegregation.   **Affirmative action isn't charity to those involved and it isn't supposed to be**  A sober look at the effect of bussing on the kids who were sent to schools with a class that hated them asked that it wasn't a charity. It wasn't even fair to them. We're did it because the country was suffering from the evil of racism and exposure is the only way to heal it.   http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/06/496411024/why-busing-didnt-end-school-segregation  Affirmative action in schools is similar. Evidence shows that students who are pulled into colleges in which they are underrepresented puts them off balance and often has bad outcomes for those individuals. The beneficiary is society as a whole. AA isn't charity for the underprivileged. Pell grants do that. AA is desegregation.   Race matters in that my children and family will share my race. The people that I care about and have the most in common with share these things. This is very important for practical reasons of access to power. Race is (usually) visually obvious and people who would never consider themselves racist still openly admit that they favor people like themselves (without regard to skin color). Think about times you meet new people:  - first date - first day of class - job interview  Now think about factors that would make it likely that you \"got along\" with people:  - like the same music - share the same cultural vocabulary/values - know the same people or went to school together  Of these factors of commonality, race is a major determinant. Being liked by people with power is exactly what being powerful is. Your ability to curry favor is the point of social class. Which is why separate but equal is never equal.  So the question is, without the ability for schools to *do* something about de facto racial segregation, how do things change?"

I’m sorry if the title is weird, but I’m really just looking for someone to reason to me why St Patrick’s Day is generally accepted as fine while other examples of cultural appropriation against other cultures is not.   St Patrick’s Day, while surely an important holiday in Ireland,  seems to me to have become this bastardization in the United States that doesn’t celebrate Ireland but rather mocks it and plays on stereotypes. This idea of the drunk Irishman, originating in the anti-Irish sentiments of the late 19th Century, seems to me to be perpetuated on St. Patrick’s Day in America. Surely people with anti-immigration views could use the photos of the frat parties and bar scenes happening today as propaganda.    The fact that there’s a Snapchat filter out today that looks like a pint glass with a scale on it from “Sober” through “drunk” to “Irish” at the top and the company hasn’t had to publicly apologize is evidence to me enough that for some reason it’s okay to mock the Irish but not other cultures. Now I understand that with issues of prejudice it’s very hard to bluntly compare cultures, but had that “scale” said “Native American” at the top, there would be boycotts, and I don’t understand how one is okay but the other is not. This leads me to believe that it’s fine because the Irish are white, but Native Americans, etc are not, stemming from this white guilt that people have about appropriation.   I suspect it’s something along the lines of how the Irish have been able to mix into “white” society and be considered white in America, but if that’s so I still believe that the idea of Cultural Appropriation and people that oppose it should present itself and theirselves as more against appropriation along racial lines rather than “cultural”.

It's often a notion that *feels* like you're picking on someone while they're already down.

And of course, when you introduce situational context that can muddy things up even more.  But in a way, yes - the concept of cultural appropriation is tied to race. In as much as race is tied to the concept of power and/or privilege. But it's also undeniable that race and culture are often linked. So I think it's more than racial. You'll find the same power dynamic when it comes to men vs. women, superiors vs. subordinates, etc. It's ultimately tied to who has privilege and power as a group in society over others.

There is a strike at your workplace. Should your employer be able to force you to cross the picket line?  I'm honestly not sure then answer, and I don't like the idea of someone being able to deny me medicine because their Sky Daddy said so, but at the same time I don't like giving employers that much control over what they can force us to do."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The Internet SHOULD be a place for nuanced discussion and the proliferation of new ideas. The fact that it is not is a failure of the user and not the platform. I tend to get into heated discussions on the Internet, reddit in particular. But people are quicker to respond with an insult, degradation, or only half-construct an argument that conveniently leaves out an important piece of information to the topic that would hinder their own argument. Vitriol and anger seem to be people’s first reaction nowadays, and I’m having trouble not leaving social media altogether akin to the way that I left Twitter and Facebook in response to vitriol and an abhorrence towards criticism.  Whether correct or incorrect or right or wrong, the first reaction many people have is to decry someone’s point. Outside of hate speech, racism, or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, a user should be able to take their hits but keep talking to whoever it is they are discussing a topic with. More and more I just shrug my shoulders and stop responding, as things get more heated and people only get more entrenched in their views. I just went through an Internet exchange where my mind was almost changed, but the person kept following up with ‘your argument is flawed’ or ‘you keep flip flopping’ every time I conceded a point or said I appreciate their point but here is why you are wrong.  I’m sure I’ll get plenty of people who will say ‘if you want nuance and civility why did you come to the Internet/reddit/social media’ to which I respond how else am I able to attempt to forge a connection with people who I am unlikely to ever meet in person? I am subject to where I live, and even my race and gender in some circles.  I believe that Internet toxicity stems from being behind the screen and not in someone’s face. We all know someone who says hateful or hurtful or conspiracy theory-fueled online that will either backtrack or avoid talking about it when it is brought up to them in person. I used to believe reddit was that place where people could debate in public in the comments without fear of vitriol or hate but I have less and less of that kind of discussion on this platform.  The kind of cogent, nuanced discussion truly needed to change someone’s views on a topic is soon to be impossible. If in the case of something that is not objectively morally wrong, I believe that the majority of users would respond with insults and not their stance on a topic.  If I went to r/gunpolitics and said the ‘second amendment in the USA is flawed because guns are far more dangerous now than the founders ever could have imagined,’ would I get arguments about how the importance of arming oneself is still important regardless of weapons technology, and arguments and evidence to back that up, or would I get everything decrying me as a communist who want to take their guns and their civil liberties? I’d argue the latter.  Maybe there is a place for discussion and using the Internet as a communication tool and not a weapon, but it’s hard to not get apathetic about this issue. You can’t keep having the same conversations with your friends. It used to be that, people had to think about what they said but now it’s all people being triggered, and those people being called shills, or someone afraid of offending so many different people that their argument is stymied or just castrated since the thing is just bland.  Change my view. Please.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " > The fact that it is not is a failure of the user and not the platform.  Firstly. I would like to change your view on this point. It is the fault of the user and the platform. How a platform is designed is going to affect what users can get away with and - by extension - what users engage. This is why discourse and content quality varies dramatically from platform to platform and subreddit to subreddit.   For example, there is a huge range of quality that you get from jumping from /r/politics to /r/PoliticalDiscussion to /r/NeutralPolitics. Why? If all of these subreddits are divisions of the same site? Merely because they have varying rules on what can be posted and how you can engage in comments. Which leads to them being having differing qualities (and quantity) of discourse.   The same goes for this sub. Someone could respond with calling you a bunch of names or telling you to suck it up, but a mod would come and remove that response because it breaks the rules.   People will be people, but only so far as you let them. I rarely engage at Neutral Politics because it requires sources for all of your major claims and I rarely have them available at hand. So I don't engage often, but when I do, I'm forced to meet a certain standard that I might not have met otherwise.   The platform's design matters.   Since you explicitly mention Twitter: I think Twitter's design is especially bad for discussion.  * Limits on characters discourages nuanced points and citing your sources often.   * The fact that you might have to spread your point across several posts makes it difficult to follow any singular thread and have a cohesive and clear discussion.  * The lack of moderation means toxic or hostile comments are almost never going to be removed.  * The fact that there is little to no community voting that increases visibility (like upvotes or likes) means you see everything with no \"value sorting\". If a comment in this thread is bad, it will be downvoted (or not upvoted) and I'd be less likely to see it when compared to a good one. On Twitter, they're all on equal footing in many cases.   All of this leads to Twitter being especially toxic in almost every way.  > I’m sure I’ll get plenty of people who will say ‘if you want nuance and civility why did you come to the Internet/reddit/social media’ to which I respond how else am I able to attempt to forge a connection with people who I am unlikely to ever meet in person? I am subject to where I live, and even my race and gender in some circles.  I agree with this point, so I won't be changing your view on how this isn't realistic, but mostly that idea is more idealistic than anything else. Yes, you can have civil discussions with people you know, but people you know will more than likely not be educated enough to have such a discussion and will - often rightfully so - shy away from the discussion entirely. I will fight you on your views to the death if I disagree, but I think friends or family are much more likely to agree-to-disagree because of their investments in your relationships.   So yes, things stay civil but they often don't push the boundaries at all, which is why so many people talk about their racist uncle/grandparent or sexist father or whoever else. Real life is not better for debate or discourse. It's better if your goal is to avoid all forms of hostility, but not if you want to find someone that will push you."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Religious mission trips do more harm than good From what I've read online about them, the two main purposes of mission trips seem to be 1) to spread their religion and 2) to do physical service work.  I find the first purpose to be really insulting to the people of the countries missionaries travel to. It sends a message that these people cannot possibly choose the best religious beliefs (or lack thereof) for themselves and need the \"help\" of missionaries to follow the \"right\" religion. These trips almost always take place in impoverished areas of the world and to me it feels like the \"saying the quiet part out loud\" in this situation would be to say that the people who go on these trips believe that poor people are stupid and easy to prey on. The source I read (linked in the first paragraph) specifically says \"many of the countries most in need of the gospel are also full of poverty, and places filled with poverty are also filled with vulnerable people\". It seems that they mean that these people are easier to convert because they are often in crisis situations and are desperate. Some go so far as to go on these trips to build a church rather than something that the community needs.  I believe that the second reason people go on these trips, physical service work, is also problematic. While the source says that you *sometimes* need medical training or degrees to do medical mission trips, it also talks about trips focusing on construction and education which you do *not* need training or degrees in. Most of the people who go on these trips are under 25 years old. It is very unlikely at these ages that they have the skills necessary to perform these tasks which means that they are potentially building unsafe structures and improperly teaching children. I also believe this is bad because it takes work away from the locals and costs more money. Rather than paying to fly yourself out there, paying for housing and meals, and using a community's resources, why not just donate money so that local people can do the work? Would it not make more sense to pay for the supplies so that a local contractor can build a school or pay for a local person's education so that they can become a teacher rather than untrained college aged people doing this work? Without paying for your own expenses, you'd have more money to give as well.  To me, it seems like these trips serve the people who go on them more than the people they say they want to help. They provide experiences for the travelers, but little to no help for people in poverty and/or crisis situations.\n\nAssistant:",

It sends a message that these people cannot possibly choose the best religious beliefs (or lack thereof) for themselves and need the \"help\" of missionaries to follow the \"right\" religion.  If I recommend a movie to a friend, am I insulting them and suggesting they're incapable of choosing movies by themselves?  If I am talking without someone about a medical problem, and suggest something that has helped me, am I suggesting they can't find out things on their own?  I suspect people who are half-hearted about their faith rarely go on these trips.  I've seen religion have negative impacts in some situations, but I've also seen it have profoundly positive impacts on certain people.  Why wouldn't such a person want to share what they've found?  Also, I'm a bit confused about your logic that these trips are harmful.  Your argument seems to be that it's because these groups could do more by donating money to locals instead of spending it on the trips.  Even if that's true, that suggests that there is a more effective way to be altruistic, but not that the trips cause harm.  If Organization A does a lot of good and Organization B does a little, then donating to Organization B is still a good thing.  Not as good as A, perhaps, but still good.  Isn't it?"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Falsely accusing someone of rape should be against the law, with repercussions similar to that of people committing rape. Falsely accusing someone of rape is mentally debilitating, ruins social interactions from long friends or total strangers potentially forever, and in the worst case people go to jail for a long time for being falsely accused.  And in many cases people who are falsely accusing others of rape get off with a slap on the wrist and a “talking to” with only a few very publicized cases actually leading to legal repercussion.  And how is someone supposed to react after being accused of rape? If they’re defensive, people assume they’re trying to bury what happened with lies. And if they do nothing, nobody ever knows what happened, and can potentially spread worse rumours, not to mention the fact that the person who falsely accused them gets to live on and possibly even forget they ever said that.   Whereas the person who was accused has to live where many people see them as an awful person, and refuse to interact with them, even going as far as to warn others not to.  People even develop the idea that maybe they did do something wrong and they didn’t know, and that it might happen again, so they’re very weary of any potentially romantic situations, ruining their self confidence and possibly sending them into a deep depression.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " No, because this would discourage reporting rape, and would criminalize true victims who cannot prove their allegation. Rape is a very hard charge to prove, as most cases come down to \"he said, she said\". This is why externalities - such as dress, behavior, etc. - are used to help determine who is telling the truth. These have been attacked in recent years, because they inherently remove agency from a woman - as in, wearing tight clothing does not mean that the woman wants to have sex, and it especially does not mean that she doesn't have the right to change her mind about sex between when she puts it on and when the two individuals are alone.   Yes, false rape allegations happen. The rate at which they happen is rather disputed, because it is difficult to distinguish between a false charge and a true charge where we don't have sufficient evidence to convict. Remember, convictions require evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and in many situations a jury can reasonably doubt that the sex was not consensual.   So knowing that, imagine that you are a woman who has been raped, perhaps by an acquaintance or a spouse, with no witnesses or evidence to show that it was not consensual. Do you make a report, in the hopes that he will confess or that evidence might exist to prove he committed the crime, or to try and establish a pattern of behavior so that he won't get away with it in the future (or even just for your own peace of mind)? Or do you refrain from making a report, because you'll probably be charged and/or convicted under the law against false rape charges?  On the whole, the fear of prosecution would reduce the number of rape allegations, both real ones and fake ones. That's not what we want. If you think that's hyperbolic, look at the case of prostitutes. Violence against prostitutes and escorts is quite common, but those crimes are seldom reported, as the women are afraid of being prosecuted for their sex work instead of being taken seriously as a victim. Some efforts have been made to protect victims from being prosecuted in this manner, but it's not universal."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: The work-from-home push by white-collar workers will eventually lead to massive outsourcing that will hurt future generations of wealthy western nations. For some generations older than mine, when they were in the workforce there was an abundance of factory jobs that provided millions of people the opportunity to earn a solid middle-class income and provide for their families. As a result of both automation and the outsourcing of labor to countries with cheaper labor, these jobs are all but gone and the middle class is a shell of what it once was. An argument that I've heard in defense of this, is that it allows for these wealthy western nations to focus more of their workforce on higher-paying professional services or white-collar jobs. Even if you assume that that statement is true, I don't see any reason why the same thing that happened to manufacturing jobs won't eventually happen to white-collar jobs that can be completed 100% virtually from home.   &#x200B;  With COVID, many jobs were forced to adapt and at least temporarily adopt a work-from-home setup. Once employees began work-from-home, many realized that there really isn't any reason to come into the office, and now won't consider any jobs that require them to come into the office 5 days a week. I think this will be a good deal for workers in the short term as it potentially gives them a little more flexibility, cuts down on their commute time, and potentially allows them to move further away from the office to a lower cost of living area. But if a job can be completed 100% from home, what's to stop employers from doing to professional services what they did to manufacturing jobs and outsourcing the work to individuals who don't expect as great a salary in return? I don't imagine this will be an instantaneous or overnight transition but it's not like people from places where the labor is cheaper are incapable of learning any job that people in wealthy western nations can. That's not to say there won't be any challenges for the outsourced white-collar jobs but the cost savings would likely make the challenges worth it in a lot of cases.   &#x200B;  So Reddit, CMV - future generations of wealthy western nations will see a similar reduction in white-collar jobs that can be completed virtually, that millennials experienced with manufacturing jobs.\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: CMV: Whenever younger folks utter the phrase \"respect is earned, not given\" I can't help but understand it as a childish and short sighted attempt to undermine their elders. While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can.   However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.   Simply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions:   1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.  2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.  3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing.   4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\".   As such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\". CMV.  ____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

    "golden_answer": " One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that skills tend to be less transferable then we assume.  A person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess doesn't actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers.  They might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they're playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average.  Another thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort.  The easiest example of this is typing speed.  People get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons.  When you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are.  What you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations.  Let's say I own a bar.  If I ask my grandparents how I should market that bar, I'm sure they'll have opinions to give me.  If I ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he'll also have opinions to give me.  My grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to.  Let's say instead of a bar, I have a tech company.  We're a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing.  If I ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then I ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, I'm likely to get very different answers.  The older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them.  They've done radio, TV, direct mail, etc.  The younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability.  I think both groups would have important insights, but I would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer.  The younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium.  So how does this tie back into what your saying?  When it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so I would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age.  I wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old.  When it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, I'm not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe.  Given all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise.  Now young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they don't know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy.  But that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference.  That's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons.  If everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things.  Even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it's not an issue worth bringing up.  edit: To quickly add to this, the times I've most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person."

For millennia borrowing the best of what works from something or someone else has made everyone better, and people who are upset about this are off base on this issue. For background, I’m pretty liberal. However, when it comes to “cultural appropriation,” I don’t get how this is a bad thing.  Prehistoric humans advanced by watching and mimicking the productive habits of others. A cat or a dog learns to open a door by mimicking what humans do.   Children learn adult behavior and social skills via mimicry. All our previous societies advanced by taking the best ideas from others they encountered. Gunpowder from China. A lot of cultural things like eating with several different utensils, wearing different clothes at different occasions, toothpaste and many other things were developed by a musician in the Moorish court. Thankfully we adopted toothpaste more globally.  When I was in Istanbul, I’d eat amazing food that had been borrowed from others and perfected over centuries. When I was there I’d see trendy restaurants serving tres leches cake, which was brand new to them and not as good as at Hispanic restaurants, but give them a decade with it and I’ll bet it’s morphed and is now amazing!  When I admire someone better dressed and more fashionable, I’ll initiate their style until I learn what works with what.   If “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” and our entire developmental history as a species and as individuals is mostly based on imitation and appropriation....why is cultural appropriation a bad thing? It seems to me that India helped Britain develop better cuisine (some of the best Indian restaurants are in London), African Americans have helped American white people develop a semblance of rhythm and appreciation for a wider variety of music, and governments all over the world have borrowed from the laws and traditions of others to achieve better governance.   What am I missing here? In what way does “cultural appropriation” rob from or damage the source culture? Or are people who object to this just too far off base to be taken seriously?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " A lot of the time, cultural appropriation has nothing to do with actually mimicking a culture. It's about taking images and bending them to the use of another culture.  For example, many Native American cultural honors (such as ceremonial garb) have been taken and used as Halloween costumes, or used as part of \"Wild West\" shows that have nothing to do with actual Native American culture, and are in fact often used to denigrate those cultures.  Let me use another example. Suppose another culture took the image of the Purple Heart and started giving out a sticker version of it to little children who get a small scratch as an \"owie fix\". Would that be okay? I suspect a lot of American service members would find this offensive, and I would say rightly so. It would be an unfair appropriation of military culture."
