I've heard from plenty of people that Columbia, for instance, has a crummy undergrad program in terms of the education you receive.  In general I don't think there's a lot of information floating around professional philosophers in terms of who has a good undergraduate program. The best way to find this out would be to ask current students. You said \"bracketing for the time being the practical factors involved in this decision\" but really what you ought to do is narrow down colleges based on those factors and *then* check which ones have good undergrad philosophy programs, because that's doable. What's *not* doable is surveying every college ever to find the good undergrad programs."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it immoral to turn your back on society and become a hermit/recluse/hikikomori? There are lots of different reasons for turning away from society, and people have become hermits and have shut out society for centuries, for dozens of different reasons - mental illness, misanthropy, religious zeal, and a loner personality, to name a few. But if you turn away from society for the reason that you recognize society itself has become corrupt and you want to detach from it, it is immoral to abandon it?  Many hermits become artists, writers, philosophers, and solitary religious laymen. Lots of them do it because their personalities do not mix well with the society of their era. Many make great contributions to society even from solitude. But many more probably don't, at least not any contributions that could be justified by their complete withdrawal. Some become completely lost in a fantasy world of their own making, like Henry Darger or Vivian Maier. Others become so overwhelmed by modern society that they become completely frozen, like the *hikikomori.* Many recluses see the severe flaws in society and become repulsed by it to the point that they can no longer connect.   I guess the crux of my question is, if a person chooses to leave society and pursue a solitary life outside of it, is it unethical to turn your back on society's problems if you could potentially help to solve them? Or are you justified in leaving them to their own devices if you're capable of pulling it off?\n\nAssistant:",

I also discuss the responses he deems ethically unacceptable. I argue that Confucius rejects the option of withdrawal from society, even where such withdrawal aims to preserve personal moral integrity. However, Confucius also cautions against deep involvement with corrupt regimes. The path he recommends centers on the individual’s power to trans-form society by modeling virtue and humanity. Although an individual may have no obligation, in certain cases, to take up government office, he does have an obligation to identify corruption in government as corruption, and he cannot fulfill this responsibility in complete isolation from others."

As I’m getting older into my mid 20’s, I’m finding myself becoming increasingly pessimistic about politics, the state of the world, the state of humanity as a collective group, and other things. I’ve always considered myself to be overly positive and optimistic.   Much of it seems to be based in ideals I hold. For example, I find myself thinking, “If only people could be like this” or “If only these politicians thought this way”. I have practical ideas, as in they’re not crazy or far off and could reasonably seen as being helpful, but I don’t expect or think they’d be implemented anytime soon given the political and social climate around me.   I’ve been trying to figure out how to turn my “pessimism” into something more positive or at least constructive. Whether that be in a personal, mental way or in a real-world, practical way.  I feel like this is a pretty common feeling. I think reading Vonnegut and Pratchett have helped some.

    "golden_answer": " As is often the case here, I'll recommend Albert Camus and specifically Myth of Sisyphus. Interestingly, Joshua Deinstag considers Camus a pessimist in his work (unsurprisingly) titled *Pessimism.* Camus, in a short essay \"Pessimism and Tyranny\" (found in *Resistance, Rebellion, and Death*) seems to make just such a claim.  One central theme, however, of Camus's corpus is his persistent refusal to give into the nihilism that pessimism can bring about. In Caligula, he shows us the potential for danger in embracing the logic of nihilistic pessimism. In Sisyphus, he presents an individualistic way out. In The Rebel, he offers us a way out of collective feelings of pessimistic nihilism and a philosophical and historical look at individuals, groups, states, etc that embraced the nihilism.  In short, Camus doesn't reject pessimism as a philosophically reasonable premise, but he offers solutions for how to live well despite the persistence of pessimism."

    "golden_answer": " I know that the strands of divine command theory that are mixed with virtue ethics, such as the program developed by Linda Zagzebski, are taken very seriously by today's moral philosophers.   Here's a Christian apologist's response to the Euthyphro dilemma. That response is characteristic of nearly every major Christian response to the dilemma since antiquity. Even Augustine responded to the dilemma in the same spirit. The dilemma just is not regarded as a serious stumbling block for divine-command theorists so long as they avoid endorsing certain conceptions of the divine.   On a different note, it's not even obvious to me that Plato advanced the dilemma as an attack on a conception of ethics. In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates was just pushing Euthyphro to give an account of piety, and Euthyphro ends up saying that piety is what the gods love. Now, either the gods love it because it's pious or it's pious because the gods love it. But nowadays we consider the option \"the gods love it because it's pious\" to imply something like \"there must be something higher than the gods, and external to them, and this thing diminishes their greatness!\" And then we take this apparent logical consequence to be a *reductio ad absurdum* of the view that \"the gods love it because it's pious.\" But that is not at all what Plato means. All Plato means is that if the gods love it because it's pious, then we want to know what piety is, and Euthyphro hasn't given us the definition. In other words, by taking that option, Euthyphro wouldn't be undermining divinity, or anything like that; he just wouldn't be answering the question. Socrates wants Euthyphro to give an account of piety. Euthyphro would have to give us the definition used by the gods! The readings of the *Euthyphro* that followed Plato's death didn't really square with Plato's system anyways, since Plato 1) believed that some god existed and 2) believed that piety exists external to this god.  Of course, modern readers can read the *Euthyphro* however they choose. It is just interesting from a historical perspective to see how the dialogue is received."

There a difference between what he's saying and what you're saying. He is not saying space and time are human constructs, he's saying space and time constrains (limits) what possible experiences the mind can produce.   I cannot experience a two dimensional object without space providing the grounds for extension, nor a series of events without time providing the grounds for sequence.   Without space and time providing the basic structure of extension and sequence, there would be no unity of a plurality of sensations such that different objects can be presented as distinct and unified, admit of both change and persistence in different respects, come one after another, in one experience.  If space and time are the constraint on what can be experienced, they can't be produced within experience, as then you'd have an incoherent story where the mind constructs its necessary preconditions for construction - resources it by definition cannot have at the outset of constructing.  Insofar as spatial and temporal objects are in experience, experience has to include the unity and limitation of both space and time necessary for such objects to be presented, and thus experience also cannot be reducible to a spatial object or temporal sequence itself.   This has many further implications, and will have bearing on prior misguided conceptions of space and time that would by contrast making the possibility of experience itself impossible."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Can anyone explain husserl and phenomenology to me please,ive been trying to research and study it and i am so terribly confused\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I've been there. My first course on phenomenology was absolutely humbling. Either way:  Husserl's goal is to solve what he believed to be the greatest epistemological crisis of science in general. He noticed how the sciences had been limited to the physical world by Galileo and Descartes so they could study mechanics, but, due to its great success, this method kept being used.   However, scientists very quickly forgot that they were not studying \"the world\" but only a self-limited version of it (the physical world, where anything that's not quantifiable by the methods of physics gets left out as not existing). Until here, all good, right? Sort of. The problem is that science is an empirical science, which is based on perception, which is something we have access to through our subjective view of the world, i.e., the objective world of sciences is grounded upon the subjective world of perception.   But sciences work, and give good results, right? Yes, they do. But, for Husserl, the matter is that science, as section of our culture, has as its goal to uncover the truth, not merely subjective or \"practical\" truths. Therefore, a new way of doing science is needed, so that science can have a strong, unwavering foundation.  Husserl saw a talk by Brentano (a naturalistic psychologist of the late 19th century) where he exposed what Husserl believed to be one of the greatest discoveries of psychology ever: the intentionality. This is the base structure of conscious acts, i.e., everything that we do with our minds has this structure: the act itself (believing, doubting, seeing, hearing, wanting, etc.), the content (a door, a dog, happiness, a theory, a smell, etc.), and a degree of existence (i.e., when we hear our friends tell us about their childhood, it has a different status as when we read about Harry Potter's childhood. Not because the latter is a \"lie,\" but because it is fictional).  Husserl arrived at this point by using one of his methods: the eidetic or phenomenological reduction and the epoché. This reduction method, i.e., allows you to figure out the \"essence\" of things by changing things about this thing as much as  you want without it not being that thing anymore and the epoché is a suspension of knowledge we have acquired from the natural world (i.e., not using things learned about the natural world to explain the subjective experience that precedes it, otherwise we would remain in an epistemological problem). You can do this with doors, changing color, size, form, etc. to understand the point. But Husserl's goal was not metaphysics, he was studying the subjectivity, so, what he did was use this method on mental structures to figure them out (like in the case of the intentionality that's present in all intentional acts). (There's also the transcendental reduction, but that one is probably not as relevant for you right now.)  He did this to many other mental structures, construction of time (past, present, future), empathy/intropathy (perceiving the other as a subjectivity like ourselves), construction of spatial objects, etc.  Important to note: 1) phenomenology is *descriptive* endeavor: it does not explain things regarding subjectivity, it merely describes them as they are; 2)  phenomenology is entirely restricted to the domain of subjectivity, it does not make claims about the natural world. It is entirely restricted to the study of subjectivity. It does not do metaphysics.   I hope I was of help. I can answer questions if you have them."

So, \"the mind\" as such emerges only from this process by which we alienate ourselves from a more ontologically basic (from the point of view of phenomenology) thing - something like an embodied mind.  Really, there is no mind as such, there is only this embodied mind.  The Cartesian mind is an important practical and theoretical concept, but it is not really the thing we have.  By way of a maybe lame analogy that maybe only works for me - there is a line in Aristotle wherein he describes the body of a dead person as \"a body in name only.\"  That is, it's not *really* a body - a body is the up and moving around thing that we have.  This pure mind that Descartes asks us to imagine through skeptical analysis ends up being something like this - a mind in name only.

    "golden_answer": " The short story is that compatibilism denies this:  > If we live in a deterministic universe, free will is impossible.  So, the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is about the necessary conditions for Free Will.   Some people think this is a cheap semantic move or something evasive, but it isn't - it's a conceptual argument about how the burden of Free Will should be understood.  Imagine someone came up to you and said, \"Hey - did you know that you can *never* make a good decision because you can *never* know what will happen with absolute certainty?\"  Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\"   That's a useless and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  This isn't a trivial game of word golf here - this is a substantive dispute about how we should think about what it means to make a \"good decision.\"  Importantly, there isn't some rock somewhere that we turn over which has this definition printed on it.  \"Free Will\" is the same way.  We might first ask what the concept is supposed to do.  One thing it is often thought to do is be a necessary condition for moral responsibility.  That is, I can't be blamed for what I do if I had no control over what I'm doing.  Once we can agree on that much (that Free Will is the thing you'd need to be morally responsible), then it should become clear that it's not obvious that libertarian free will (the kind of free will which determinism would deny - the weird freedom from causality) is necessary for moral responsibility.  As a result, there have been lots of theories of moral responsibility which accept determinism going back, at least, to the ancient stoics (who developed a pretty famous ethical system and were causal determinists).  In sum - it's hard to know what you do or don't \"get,\" but it may just be that you have found yourself in that spot that a lot of first-time readers of compatibilism have found themselves in - thinking that the compatibilist is trying to pull a fast one or something.  That's not what's happening.  If anything, it's the Hard Determinists who are doing this, by trying to claim the necessary conditions for Free Will were decided already in a way which can't be contested.  This is nonsense.  Abstract and material terms are subject to contest and revision.  If they weren't, then the Hard Determinists couldn't avail themselves of a modern definition of causality.  ETA - My above analogy seems to have been helpful, but also a bit misleading.  So, to clarify a part of my analogy:  > Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\" That's a *useless* and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  Some folks have seized on one clause in this hypothetical, but, really, I didn't mean it to be terribly important.  Really the argument here is about a *good* definition for Free Will.  (To be fair, I do also think that important concepts need some kind of utility.)  The argument between my two imagined persons is about the *better* way to think about a particular concept.  I avoid saying \"right\" or \"accurate\" here to avoid some other conceptual problems, though I think it's all the same thing.  Anyway, imagine an alternate situation instead from the point of view of the libertarian.  Say that the libertarian meets a person who declares, \"We have no free will!\"  The Libertarian says, \"Oh, yes!  I agree!  But, just in case, why do you think this?\"  The interlocutor says, \"Oh, well, having free will requires that I can do what I want.  I want to fly.  I cannot fly.  Therefore, I cannot do what I want to do.  Therefore, I don't have free will.\"  Whatever we can say about Libertarians, they don't believe *this*.  Clearly the Libertarian disagrees with this interlocutor.  Wherein lies the disagreement?  Probably the Libertarian will say this, \"No - I think you're a bit confused about what it might mean to 'do what you want' or else you're just confused about what having Free Will entails.\"  (Also, by the way, might not the Libertarian point out that this is a very silly way to think about Free Will given that everyone knows before the conversation starts that humans can't will themselves into flight?  This interlocutor has defined and ended the argument before it started.)  Anyway, here, the Libertarian would not be engaging in some semantic mumbo jumbo by trying to show this person that they've conceived of things wrongly.  If the Libertarian's response to this interlocutor is mumbo jumbo, then what does their own position even amount to?  Neither party of this dispute can turn over a rock to see who wins - they'll need to give some arguments for thinking that Free Will requires [x] or [y] - regardless of whether or not is *exists*.  As others have pointed out below, people have some kind of conception of Free Will and what matters about it, but this doesn't mean that all of those conceptions make sense or are equally good or, if you're willing, are *true*.  When we ask people what they think about Free Will, we learn *something*, but we don't obviously learn something about Free Will *itself*.  In the same way, we could ask people on the street what Time is and not learning anything about Time *itself*.  Here too, there is no easy rock to look under to find out what Time *is* (or else the A vs B debate would be long dead).  Or, if you don't buy this analogy, consider that folk definitions of Free Will almost always rely on a notion of Causation, and yet folk notions of Causation are often totally at odds with even what scientists think causation is like (much less philosophers).  Anyway, all I meant to do above is show one way to see how the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is something other than word golf or semantics.  And, to be really clear, philosophers who are divided about this are not confused here - folks in all the camps about Free Will give rather sustained arguments for their positions and understand this to be totally necessary to making their position justifiable - even the libertarians and hard determinists.  As a final amendment, some folks have suggested that what Compatibilists are doing is making a \"new\" definition for Free Will.  This also isn't true, since Compatibilist arguments go back *at least* to the Ancient Greek Stoics.  If that counts as \"new,\" well, then *everything* about modern hard determinism, unless, of course, Hard Determinists are using a theory of physical causation, the soul, and human motivation derived from Aristotle.  (Some do this, of course!)"

I can still remember the time before cell phones and social media and how I could easily occupy my time just thinking.....daydreaming, but now, I don't see a future where a single soul is out of the cave, constantly bombarded by information, some sensory stimulation, they all soon could see this way of living as \"life\" as what reality just is, \"disconnecting\" or coming out the cave would be unknown, or turned into some high priced weekend retreat for the next generation, \"electronic-less living\" I think they'd call it, filled to the brim of course with negatives against it as the corporatism ravages society pushing us further to be consumers.      are there any contemporary philosophers who speak on the allegory in this way?\n\nAssistant:",

    "golden_answer": " The ones I've enjoyed the most are the Bryan Magee interviews, uploaded by some saintly figure called flame0430.   They're a series of interviews with major philosophers of the time. Magee and his guests discuss another philosopher or a philosophical tradition or subject. Seemingly they were recorded  for a TV show in the 70s (? early 80s maybe?). As such, they are aimed at a general audience, but they are certainly not dumbed down.  Besides the quality of the interviews, which is very high, they're interesting because the interviewees are often philosophers you'll inevitably encounter by the end of an undergrad degree, and you'll probably have read at least a couple of them. These are Big Deal guys - Quine, Putnam, Searle, Singer, Ayer, Nussbaum, Derrida, etc. It's one of those weird little TV ideas that occasionally slips past everyone and actually gets made. It's the closest thing in philosophy to finding old concert footage of the Beatles or Hendrix. You might have heard the tunes before, but not like this, and didn't they dress funny?!  There are a couple of other videos on the channel which aren't part of that series, in particular a couple of panels with Quine, one mostly biographical (very unusual) and another more philosophical in its focus.  edit: I should clarify that it's not Quine's biography which is unusual. It's actually quite dull, and doubly so the way Quine tells it. I was talking about the biographical interview format. Thought I should point that out in case anyone gets excited."

It’s size can be intimidating for some but it is truly his best and most comprehensive work.  David Harvey and others have good guides for reading capital.

    "golden_answer": " Existentialism and absurdism can be understood as two different but very similar responses to nihilism.   Nihilism, more specifically existential nihilism, argues that life has no intrinsic meaning, purpose, or value.   Both existentialism and absurdism accept this but respond in different ways.   Existentialism in its broadest sense refers to a tradition of European philosophers who begin with individual human existence and authenticity. In the narrow sense, which is to say from Sartre, existentialism's response to nihilism is that we as radically free subjects thrown into a meaningless universe are solely responsible for the meaning we give it.   Absurdism, a philosophy most attributed to Albert Camus, takes as central the absurd desire for humans to seek inherent value despite the meaninglessness of the world (nihilism). Absurdism further argues that all attempts to find meaning, either inherent or from one's self (existentialism), will ultimately fail but we should embrace the Absurd (the contradictory co-existence of the value-seeking human mind and the valueless world) and defiantly seek meaning anyway.

    "golden_answer": " At the very beginning of his book, 'Beyond Good and Evil', Nietzsche tears down many philosophical viewpoints, including stoicism. He writes:  You want to *live* 'according to nature'? O you noble Stoics, what fraudulent words! Think of a being such as nature is, prodigal beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without aims or intentions, without mercy or justice, at once faithful and barren and uncertain; think of indifference itself as a power - how *could* you live according to such indifference? To live - is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is living not valuating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And even if your imperative 'live according to nature' meant at bottom the same thing as 'live according to life' - how could you *not* do that? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?- The truth of it is, however, quite different: while you rapturously pose as deriving the canon of your law from nature, you want something quite the reverse of that, you strange actors and self-decievers! Your pride wants to prescribe your morality, your ideal, to nature, yes to nature itself, and incorporate them in it; you demand that nature should be nature 'according to the Stoa' and would like to make all existence exist only after your own image - as a tremendous eternal glorification and universalisation of Stoicism! All your love of truth notwithstanding, you have compelled yourselves for so long and with such persistence and hypnotic rigidity to view nature *falsely*, namely Stoically, you are no longer capable of viewing it in any other way - and some abysmal arrogance infects you at last with the Bedlamite hope that, *because* you know how to tyrannize over yourselves - Stoicism is self-tyranny - nature too can be tyrannized over: for is the Stoic not a *piece* of nature?... But this is and old never-ending story: what formerly happened with the Stoics still happens today as a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image, it cannot do anything otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to 'creation of the world', to *causa prima*"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How do I learn about Hegel without having to actually read him? Hegel's texts are famously difficult to understand, but are there any good secondary books which provide an introductory  level explanation/analysis of his ideas?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " There are a couple issues which complicate the answer to this question. In a sense, it all depends on *which* Hegel you want to learn. One can certainly read secondary material which gives an intepretation of Hegel's project, but without any engagement with the primary source, you will be left largely unable to do 2 key things: (1) distinguish between better or worse interpretations and (2) thereby, determine when a disagreement you have with 'Hegel' is actually with him, or with an interpreter's idiosyncratic reading of him.   While I believe it is generally worthwhile to engage with Hegel's primary source material, you may have specific reasons for your need to engage with Hegel that, given the difficulty of such study, make this a less valuable way to spend your time. For example, if you are really just interested in the influence of Hegel on French thought in the latter half of the 20th century, (e.g. because you want to just understand *those* projects more thoroughly), then you may not *absolutely* need to read Hegel directly -- (however, I would still of course personally recommend it.) The reason for this is that this influence was, by and large, shaped by the readings of Hegel developed by Kojeve and Hyppolite. Still, it might be argued that any adequate understanding of a philosophical project would include recognition of where that project's plausibility (or validity or whatever) depends on *mis*-understanding or only partially understanding some project to which it takes itself to respond. In that case, it may become worthwhile, yet again, to read the original texts of Hegel.   Now, that's just one example, but hopefully it gives a sense of what I mean. There are many good introductory books on Hegel, but a number of them disagree on basic issues. As such, it might be helpful if you provided a little bit more context.   As such, the first thing I might do is point you to the SEP article on Hegel, which gives both a rough summary of the comparatively uncontested understanding of Hegel's philosophy and a breakdown of some of the larger disagreements in the secondary literature. Likewise, it generally cites the figures to whom the major interpetative stances belong, so you can probably follow it's direction if one or the other sounds most relevant or compelling to you.  I hope that helps!"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Nietzsche and women? In *Human, all too Human* he says contradictory passages. He mentions that there can be women of free spirit, but before that he says how incapable women are. He also mentions that women will eventually \"inherit all of men's traits\", but he also mentions the chaos that comes when women emancipate. And, of course, \"the best woman is better than the best man\".  In *The Gay Science* he mentions how dumb it is to expect women to be chaste before being wed, and then sexual demons after that.  In *Beyond Good and Evil* he suddenly starts throwing shit at them out of the left field, even saying that \"profound men\" should \"own women\" (238), but he also says that women are good at lies, manipulation and ignorance of truth (232, and this is probably a compliment in this context). In 234 he also says that women being bad at the kitchen is what has held humanity back, though I'm not sure if this a parable or not.  From reading his books, it seems undeniable that Nietzsche was sexist, though it's hard to say if he wanted women to emancipate and was warning to its difficulties, that it was a social norm that was unbreakable, or that he thought that women were intrinsically worse than men in what he was interested in, and he thought that was okay.  Also, I read in an article that he was actually in favor of women studying higher studies when he was a professor (uncommon at the time) and that he was good friends with some feminist women.  So, what's going on here? Is this guy just confused about women?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Instead of doing a close reading of the paragraphs you just mentioned (which cannot be done within this context), I would rather ask myself, why something that Nietzsche wrote about women (as part of his philosophical prose) should tell us anything about his own sentiments. You will find will find passages that seem extremely misogynistic (at first glance) and some that don't. Even in the *Gay Science* you will find aphorisms that contradict any supposedly misogynistic tendencies (take aphorism 71 for example).  Take *Thus spoke Zarathustra* and the famous passage about the whip (ZA I, 18. Old and Young Women). People take that to be the unmistakable proof that Nietzsche hated women and encourages to hit them with the whip. If we look at the context though, we find that the quote is from a passage where Zarathustra meets an old woman that asks him to talk about women with her. He does so, reluctantly (because in his opinion one should only talk about women in front of men), and says some remarkably misogynistic stuff. The last word though has the old woman who tells him: \"Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!\"—   This leaves us with several questions: (1) why should we believe Zarathustra in his misogynistic tirade? (2) Does the old woman by saying he should take the whip when he goes to women make fun of Zarathustra? (3) What, or rather: for whom, is the whip for?  The above mentioned passage also includes the line:  \"Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman hath one answer—it is called pregnancy.\" spoken by Zarathustra which is a direct quote by Schopenhauer. Since Zarathustra is a really ridiculous person, Nietzsche, by having him quote Schopenhauer, also ridicules Schopenhauer's sexism.   I do agree though, that Nietzsche is a very tough read and that if you don't like authors that write stuff that is contradicting and seems obscure or confused, you might not have very much fun with him. Reading Nietzsche also mostly tells you more about yourself than about Nietzsche (broadly speaking: if people read Nietzsche and take him to be the first neckbeard or a massive misogynist or a quasi-nazi they only show that they haven't read carefully enough and are satisfied with superficial and easy interpretations). You can of course take everything literally and say that Nietzsche hated women, developed a proto-racist ideology with his Übermensch and disliked Jews, Christians, the English etc. but that would be either intellectually disingenuous or a really bad interpretation (or both).  &#x200B;"

I have seen a common idea raised by some philosophers, as well as on askphilosophy, that society benefits from the obscure writings of philosophy by way of a trickle down effect, similar to the idea of trickle down economics. I was just reading Hume's Enquiry, for instance, where he writes:   *\"though a philosopher may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling.\"*   The first question I have is is this statement correct? Does philosophically obscure writing genuinely diffuse itself into broader culture? How can we know that largescale cultural shifts are influenced by philosophers, and not say, popular novels or television shows? It seems questionable to me that a book or essay read only by a tiny minority of academics can have a significant impact upon the thoughts of billions. Might it not be true that it is the other way around? That the common sense of the masses dictates current trends in philosophy?   My second question is, if trickle down philosophy is a real thing, is its influence beneficial? To my mind, the philosopher that had the largest impact on popular culture was probably Marx, but given that people's misunderstanding of Marx lead to all sorts of atrocities in the 20th century I'm not sure that the diffusion of Marx in this case was good for society. I'm not saying here that Marx was a bad thinker (to be honest I haven't even read him) but that the popularisation of his ideas was perhaps disastrous.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " To quote Hegel, the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk, which is to say that philosophy (or wisdom) only takes place at the end of events which have taken place. On the contrary to 'trickle-down,' philosophers, insofar as they are concerned with society, are at the very end of the course of human affairs, but capable of distilling it down to an essence, giving it a name and articulating what everyone already knows but cannot put so precisely into words, which itself becomes an entity in history.   The Age of Enlightenment, for example, didn't spring up from pure thought but was, in part, a response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, as described in Voltaire's *Candide*. And Marx, too, was a student of history, who noted the social transformation of feudal Europe to capitalism which informed his materialist conception of history, and, I believe, informed his skepticism that a socialist revolution could be successful in Russia due to its lack of an advanced capitalist phase.   This is all to say that philosophy is a part of history, it is both a product of prior affairs and contributor to broader culture and its self-understanding."

Hopefully not too ignorant of a question, I'm pretty new to reading about theories of consciousness. Maybe I'm missing something?  I understand materialism as consciousness being based on matter, some kind of result of physical reactions to inputs.  Someone with a mental illness like schizophrenia, which might be related to dopamine problems in the brain, means that there's physical difference that effects their conscious experience. Similar for drugs, a new chemical is introduced and the conscious experience of the person receiving the drug changes significantly. With anesthetics consciousness seems to go away completely and psychedelics alter it.  It seems like the fact that when chemicals in the brain are modified, conscious experience changes would be a strong piece of evidence for materialism?

    "golden_answer": " There are a lot of people contrasting dualism with materialism here, but I'd also like to point out that there are other accounts of mind, too. For example, dual aspect theory is a monistic theory that there is one kind of substance, and both the mental and the physical are manifestations of, or perespectives on,  this substance. In which case, \"materialism\" on its own would not be the whole picture, rather it would be one aspect of the picture. The brain wouldn't necessarily have to be more \"fundamental\" than the mind. When we see a brain state differing, and a mental state differing, these would just be two perspectives on the same substantive change.   Idealism is also another alternative, which says that reality is mind-dependent. In other words, our minds constitute all of reality, and all that reality actually is, fundamentally, is how our minds represent mental contents. In which case, all that a change in brain state actually is is a change in our mental representation of reality - we're misunderstanding reality when we think that this change in brain states is referring to something apart from our minds like a physical brain separable from its representation. The idealist would say that anyone who thinks the kinds of examples you give are proofs of materialism, are actually presupposing materialism from the start. Because if you don't presuppose materialism (or something similar) then you have no reason to believe that the changes in \"brain states\" you're seeing are changes in something materially separable from the mental, and therefore no reason to assume that there is anything that needs to be accounted for by the non-materialist."

This argument will stand or fall depending on how plausible whatever the defining quality being posited is. For instance, rational capacity seems overly restrictive, since it cuts out infants and the very old from moral consideration (can we eat them?) A more plausible option, the ability to suffer, seems like it includes animals (unless we adopt some very weird Cartesian view on which animals are just automata). So picking a quality here is going to be tricky.  Other possible reasons: nothing is morally impermissible since there are no moral facts, moral permissibility is determined by cultural convention which favours meat-eating, eating animals is somehow in their best interest (because we breed lots of them which we'd stop doing if we didn't eat them). I don't find these reasons very plausible, but then again I don't think eating meat is morally okay."

Einstein then showed that space and time are relative, as well as part of the same field called \"space-time\". Are there any philosophers or physicists who thought about how these two very fundamental ideas of space and time relate to each other?  Do they contradict each other? Do they complement each other? Do they together lead to an entirely new insight?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " In the transcendental aesthetic Kant argues for the transcendental ideality of space as the form of outer sense and for the transcendental role of this pure intuition as the condition for the a priori syntheses involved in geometry. And then this sets up a larger argument extending through the transcendental analytic, according to which geometry is then a pure science of the relations holding between spatial things, so that we can know apodictically that physical things must be adequate to geometrical description, and this thereby furnishes us with an epistemology justifying one of the methodological peculiarities of modern physics.  The way these issues develop in the critical response developed from Helmholtz through Mach to logical positivism is that philosophers will increasingly distinguish different senses of space: intuitive space, as the space of our imagination and visual perception; formal space, as the space constructable in geometry; and physical space, as the space of physical relations.  The challenge is that these senses seem to be collapsed, or at least intrinsically connected, on Kant's view. As, on Kant's view, it seems that intuitive space provides the conditions for formal space and these two jointly provide the conditions for physical space, such that if intuitive space is Euclidean, then so must formal and physical space be.  Whereas, on the critical reception, these three senses of space become more independent. I.e., on this later view, it could be that intuitive space is Euclidean, but that doesn't mean formal space has to be, and indeed it seems that mathematicians can construct a variety of formal spaces, including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. And since this freedom of mathematicians permits us to think of these different spaces, there is likewise a freedom in physics to choose which of them is adequate to the demands of physical theory, as happens in the choice of non-Euclidean geometry for space as constructed in general relativity.  Underpinning this move is the rejection of Kant's dual-source model of knowledge which categorically distinguished between intuition and understanding as joint bases of cognition, and which manifests in the distinction in Kant's epistemology between the transcendental aesthetic and transcendental analytic. On Kant's view, this mooring of understanding to intuition, as joint factors, restricts the capacity of the understanding to posit mathematical structures to those which can be exhibited in intuition. Conversely, on the later view when the understanding has been unmoored from a supposedly distinct doctrine of intuition, it is free to construct whatever mathematical structures can be grounded on merely the principles of conceptual construction as such.  And then the experimental challenge would be: if it turns out that scientific findings demand this later approach, then this would provide us with a prima facie reason to prefer it over Kant's."

Then he kinda just rambles about how every nation has had oppressed classes and that most places in the 1800/1900s were shit for most people, not just those colonised. He does clarify that what the west did was wrong and says we should do better, but then he kinda just goes back to talking about how the colonised aren’t unique victims of oppression and how so many humanities courses just talk about “bullshit” like gender theory, post colonialism and  poststructualism.   This just seems lazy and irresponsible as an episode on Fanon. You take one of the most influential post colonial writers, sum up his philosophy as “i want blacks to oppress whites now” and then chat shit about how humanities courses suck.

    "golden_answer": " That's a super painful 17 minutes.  I would say, in the first place, let's take it for what it is - it's not a podcast about Fanon, right.  Sugrue is more or less shooting the breeze with his daughter in relation to a chapter she just read - I don't say \"about\" because they don't say anything about the subject of that chapter, the relationship between the colonized subject and language.  What Sugrue does say is puzzling and on a range between accidentally deceptive to the audience (when he talks about emotion and violence) to just wrong (when he talks about the reversal of colonialism ending with nothing other than amoral black supremacy).  Moreover, parts of his analysis are weirdly self-contradictory, as when he seems to criticize Fanon's psychologism, and then basically gives a (incredibly superficial) psychologistic reading of Fanon as being, basically, a very mad dying guy who is angry about \"every slight\" ever visited on him.  Yet, later, it seems like he more or less cops to the idea that colonialism was horrible and genocide is horrible and that atonement is necessary, but, like, the idea that this atonement might itself be violent is, I guess, so unimaginable that Fanon is just a guy \"with matches.\"  As you estimate, this just can't be a very good reading of Fanon, and I don't think it really intends to be.  I think we could and should reasonably criticize him for putting this nonsense out into the ether, but it's plainly non-serious discourse where he's just kind of dishing dissess and platitudes with his daughter as the two of them share cross-generational catholic angst about the downfall of western civilization thanks to the bankruptcy of academia - he a late/end career Great Books professor and she an undergraduate struggling through the detritus of the 20th century post-blah-blah humanities.  So, anyway, I think the question here ought to be reigned in with respect to what happens.  Is Sugrue reliable?  Well, about what and in what setting?  I'm not really sure what we could take him to be reliable *about* here because he doesn't really talk about anything specific in much level of detail and, when it does, it's a kind of weird mess (as you suggest).  Now, compare this to what his old *Great Courses* lectures are like.  They're prepared, for one thing, and they're specific and exegetical, for another thing.     So, centering this on the person is, I think, likely to be confounding because a person can do a lot of things in a lot of contexts.  If you want an entertaining (if partial, because of how he see's Plato historically) detailed exegesis of Plato, then his old lectures are great.  And, to his credit, he's actually a pretty serviceable interpreter of Nietzsche and (at least back when he did his old *Great Courses* lectures) gives a pretty sensitive reading of Nietzsche.  (He calls him both one of the greatest thinkers in the whole western tradition, and also calls him a racist, mysoginist, and anti-semite.)  Things, though, start to come apart as he gets closer and closer to the 21st century.  His critiques of Lyotard and the Frankfurt school, for instance, often appear as something more like schematic afterthoughts rather than sustained commentary, but the exegesis is still sometimes good."

Faced with unsettling questions about the nature of reality philosophers seem remarkably serene and secure in who they are. In short the vast majority of philosophers don't seem to be constantly having existential crises.  As someone who frequently suffers from quite crippling existential anxiety it would be nice to have some insight into how philosophers cope so well.   At the moment I'm struggling with eternalism if anyone has an specific insight. How can I look forward to a future which is already existing and experienced? Why should I be glad a painful experience is over if it still exists? How do I reconcile any of this with my experience of the world where I seem to be moving from one present moment to the next? These questions might contain some dubious logic but they bother me significantly.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " > How can I look forward to a future which is already existing and experienced?  The same way you would normally look forward to the future, i.e. by anticipating the future event as something pleasant, or something like this.  For instance, I'm thinking of having a club sandwich tomorrow and those are yummy, so when I think about having a club sandwich tomorrow I look forward to it.  > Why should I be glad a painful experience is over if it still exists?  Because you like not to be in pain.  For instance, a few days ago I stubbed my toe and it hurt.  Then a few minutes later it stopped hurting, and since I like not to be in pain, I was glad.  > How do I reconcile any of this with my experience of the world where I seem to be moving from one present moment to the next?  I have no idea.  Why do you think something is true if you regard as irreconcilable with your experience?  > These questions might contain some dubious logic but they bother me significantly.  I think they do contain some dubious logic, and I wonder if that's relevant to your original question.  We have frequently gotten people here expressing that they're in an existential crisis because of such-and-such an insight they regard as philosophical--and looking therefore to commiserate with philosophers.  But it seems to me that what gets represented as philosophical insights in those cases is fairly reliably a piece of highly dubious reasoning.  Accordingly, what get called philosophical insights in these cases, it seems to me, are typically reasoning of a kind philosophers are likely to repudiate, rather than reasoning of a kind we'd be inclined to associate with philosophers--or at least reasoning of a kind which philosophical training would incline one to quickly see as untenable.  If that's right, then we might suppose that the reason philosophers are so unperturbed by these dilemmas is that they're readily able to see through the shoddy reasoning that rests behind them.  It might be doing harm if people think that the profession of philosophy somehow supports the idea of being severely anxious because one has gained the right kind of insight into the world, so it might at least be worthwhile to clarify that this idea is probably a misunderstanding of philosophy.  When people have severe anxiety which they report as being over a highly dubious piece of reasoning, I think we ought to wonder whether it's a case of pre-existing anxiety that is being worked into a narrative or explanation, rather than such reasoning really sufficing to explain the anxiety.  In any case, while I do think there's some merit to the idea of philosophical practice as a kind of mental therapy, I'd suggest that anyone having severe anxiety should consult with their family doctor or a mental health practitioner, even if they feel that anxiety is motivated by a philosophical problem."

    "golden_answer": " This is a response to u/MusicSpot1's question in the last weekly thread on how philosopher's choose research topics.   \r   This story is (academically) pretty wild, some people find it entertaining.  sorry the writing here is rough, I am just writing it up for fun.  \r   I think there are people here who want to know more about what modern philosophers (and related fields) do.\r   Before I get into the story of how I found my topic, I have some housekeeping to do.\r   \r   **First and foremost:** Calling out/making beef with strangers I have never met is not the purpose of this post. Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not go harassing some of the scholars I talk about, despite their terrible takes. These are issues to be dealt with in journal articles and NOT random internet strangers harassing people. As far as I am concerned the matters discussed have been addressed.\r   \r   **Second, I want to provide some context on my academic background:**  \r   I have a master's degree in music composition, and strong subject-matter experience in Musicology. My main area of interest is in American composer Lou Harrison, parts of whose life and works I am considered an expert on. I also have dabbled in discussing the relationship between late 19th/early 20th century French music and Orientalism, which happens to have a fair amount of crossover with Harrison criticism.  \r   Philosophically, I am interested in action, ethics, pedagogy, and emotions. I am a huge Martha Nussbaum fan. out of every scholar/author I have read she has probably had the largest impact on my writing and approach to academics.\r   \r   Anyways, on to the story of how I fell into a research topic, and how the crazy stuff I found changed my thesis.\r   \r   The topic I am currently involved in is discussing the ethics of cultural appropriation in the context of music scholarship. Most recently I wrote and presented at a conference, a very brief version of a 75 page paper on the subject matter (this was in 2021).\r   In Lou Harrison scholarship there are two extreme camps (I'm exaggerating their positions here for the sake of clarity, I don't have time for lit review), with some people being a little more subtle than others:  \r   1) Lou Harrison could do nothing wrong, his music is not cultural appropriation. How do you even suggest this?  \r   2) Lou Harrison is a hardcore Orientalist and a Musical Colonist.  \r   To make matters worse, most of the scholars on the subject had some sort of personal relationship with Harrison, or are white gamelan musicians/composers with serious stakes as they pertain to the question: \"Was Lou Harrison an appropriator?\" It is really REALLY difficult to find any scholarship on the topic that is not serving some sort of personal agenda.\r   Generally speaking, the people in camp #2 don't really address any of the concerns of the people in camp #1, since the folks in camp #1 knew Harrison to be a very nice guy with strong moral convictions. Camp #1 believes camp #2 is very unfair to Harrison. Camp #2 tends to found its critiques of Harrison on post-colonial scholarship, which camp #1 believes denies the historical fact that Harrison was a good person with good intentions who studied gamelan directly.\r   \r   The people in camp #1 tend to have been friends with Harrison in life, or have personal stakes in writing for Javanese Gamelan ensemble, so are obviously going to take issue with camp #2. Camp #1 also has some pretty bad arguments as to explain what Harrison did was not appropriation/isn't problematic in some way.\r   \r   The first line that really drove me batty is from a popular and recent (and actually quite good) Harrison biography:  >\r   \"to paint Harrison as a cultural colonialist and “appropriator” of artistic resources is a naive moral judgement...As a gay man, \\[sic\\] sympathized with victims of bigotry, including those subjected to colonialism\"  \r   \rThis line bothered me when I first encountered it, but I was still trying to explain away Harrison's cultural appropriation. Tackling the problem from an ethics perspective hadn't quite occurred to me yet. It goes without saying that the argument is a weak ethical argument, and a frustrating blemish on a really good book.\r   \r   It was not until I encountered an article entitled “Issues of Pastiche and Illusions of Authenticity in Gamelan-Inspired Composition” by an English(?) gamelan scholar that I ended up with my paper topic. \r   \r   **Short Summary of the article**\r   \r   The author of this article is interested in what may constitute “authentic” Javanese music, and an authentic expression of “bi-musicality.” Bi-musicality means a way of operating in and between two distinct musical traditions as to create a hybrid sort of music. I’ll get back to what reasons Sorrell had for arguing this when I talk about why I LOATHE this article in a bit.\r   \r   Sorrell argues for the existence of a sort of “bi-musicality” and critiques Harrison’s music as  appropriative, with his main issue being “cultural projection.” Harrison’s use of just-intonation in his writing for gamelan ensemble is an example of projecting the composer’s western ideology onto gamelan, which is compounded by, “Harrison’s appropriation of Javanese terminology, as it carries specific expectations and suggests a more genuinely Javanese product than in fact exists.” (Sorrell, 41) \r   \r   Up to this point, Sorrell’s article isn’t problematic. I think he actually had some very good points, but then he goes on and admits to lying about his name and race in a public concert to prove a point about perceived authenticity and why his own music is bi-musical (and therefore not appropriative).\r   \r  >“In order to deflect unwelcome focus on myself as the composer \\[of Missa Gongso\\], but even more to convey an illusion of authenticity to enhance the reception of the work, I adopted a pseudonym. In fact I invented a totally fictitious 20th-century Italian-Javanese composer (even more bi-musical than I could hope to be) by the fanciful name of Napoleon Sutono (abbreviated to ‘Napotono’), whose musical loves were gamelan, European polyphony and, above all, J.S. Bach.” (Sorrell, 44)\r   \r  This passage made me so angry, and it was upon reading I knew I absolutely needed to crush this man (academically, of course. From what I hear he is actually quite nice). It was also in this passage where I realized that the main avenue of inquiry I should be exploring was NOT whether or not the music was appropriative, but rather the ethics of writing appropriative music. What makes appropriation unethical?\r   \r   The strategy of many of the articles I had read was to make ontological claims about what was/wasn’t appropriation, and then to show that something was/wasn’t ethical based on whether or not it was appropriation (Sorrell the biggest offender). \r   \r   This methodology is flawed, so I went diving for writings on the ethics of knowledge and appropriation and wound up finding Miranda Fricker’s *Epistemic Injustice*.\r   \r   Eventually I revised my thesis. I moved away from defending Harrison on ethical grounds, and instead argued that his defenders need to be more reflective of the epistemic harms of their practices. My issue was not with musical content, but with the social context in which appropriative works are performed."

I've never heard anyone question this notion before. I've always just taken its meaning for granted, as have other people, from what I gather. Everyone I've ever asked has been able to label a color or a couple of colors as their \"favorites\". I've always been able to do the same. But upon reflection, I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly what information I gained from their answers.  Other questions relating to preferences provide answers with much clearer and easily tracable meaning. \"What is your favorite dish?\", though ostensibly similar to the question of color seems to me to give me a far more meaningful insight into one's mental state. Perhaps an analogous question for the gustatory sense would be \"what is your favorite taste?\". But this question seems much more silly for some reason, which I can only ascribe to the greater intensity, and by extension clarity in communication, of visual over gustatory stimuli.

I'll take a stab at your second question.  >(2) Why doesn't an analogous concept appear to exist for any other senses (gustatory, auditory, etc.)?  I think they do exist for those people who have stronger senses of smell and taste, at least.  I consider myself to have a really robust sense of smell and taste. And I realize this is anecdotal but I have intense memories of certain smells and tastes to the point that I can vividly recall them at will. I suspect this catalog of smells allows me to rank them and have intuitions on my favorites kinds, analogous to also having a favorite color.  For example, I think my favorite smell might be Hibiscus concentrate. And I really love Fruity and floral smells in general. The smell of a just ripened enough banana is heaven to me.  I wonder if some of the problem of it seeming if people in general have no favorite smell but having a favorite color might stem from: (1) lacking the language for naming types of smells; (2) some people have really weak senses of taste and smell; and (3) no one ever seems to ask you time and time again what's your favorite smell like they do with what's your favorite color throughout nearly your entire life.  Try it yourself and see if by looking through ten major types of smells you are then better able to rank them, if not outright pick a favorite(s). **Note:** this is not a perfectly scientific list but it should have the desired effect regardless of its astuteness.  **Olfactory Space**   * Fragrant (e.g. florals and perfumes)  * Fruity (all non-citrus fruits)  * Citrus (e.g. lemon, lime, orange)  * Woody and resinous (e.g. pine or fresh cut grass)  * Chemical (e.g. ammonia, bleach)  * Sweet (e.g. chocolate, vanilla, caramel)  * Minty and peppermint (e.g. eucalyptus and camphor)  * Toasted and nutty (e.g popcorn, peanut butter, almonds)  * Pungent (e.g. blue cheese, cigar smoke)  * Decayed (e.g. rotting meat, sour milk)"

    "golden_answer": " Do not feel bad, OP.  There is no good reason for an educator to throw this essay at students in an online class.  I'll use this version for reference.  There are a couple big chunks you need to understand.  Nietzsche's project in this essay, in the most general and reductive sense, it to shit on language.  To do that he needs to establish a few things.  > What men avoid by excluding the liar is not so much being defrauded as it is being harmed by means of fraud. Thus, even at this stage, what they hate is basically not deception itself, but rather the unpleasant, hated consequences of certain sorts of deception.  Humans do not like truth for its own sake, and dislike dishonesty for its own sake.  Humans like pleasure and dislike pain.  When someone says \"I dislike liars\" they mean \"I dislike the harmful, painful effects of lies.\"  Nietzsche needs to establish this to undermine language.  If what humans care about above all is *truth*, then Nietzsche is wrong.  If what humans care about above all is *avoiding pain*, then Nietzsche can say that language and concepts and the like are fundamentally a system to try and avoid pain, rather than a system to try and convey genuine reality.  Analogy/Example:  When you're on a date, you are not employing language to scientifically accurately mirror reality.  You employ language to try and get laid.  All language, for Nietzsche, is like that.  We're trying to use language to achieve pleasure and avoid pain, rather than trying to use language to accurately articulate complete correct reality.  > It is this way with all of us concerning language; we believe that we know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things—metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities.  For the sake of example, let's say you have a bird named Beatrice you really like.  The word \"Beatrice\", the words you use to describe the bird, will never fully wholly encompass what Beatrice is.  Your history with Beatrice, her colors, the tricks she knows, all of that experience is only kinda vaguely pointed to with the word \"Beatrice\", and the words you use to describe Beatrice.  You're never going to capture the whole experience of interacting with \"Beatrice\" with words.  That's how all words work.  They are vague approximations of reality.  > We know nothing whatsoever about an essential quality called \"honesty\"; but we do know of countless individualized and consequently unequal actions which we equate by omitting the aspects in which they are unequal and which we now designate as \"honest\" actions.  When you say \"I love my bird Beatrice\" and your friend says \"I love my dog Hank\", you each say \"love\", but the particular feelings you have, the memories your friend has, the emotional attachment you each individually feel for your individual pets is different.  And yet you use the same word, \"love\".  Nietzsche thinks that is weird.  The bundle of felt emotions you have, and the bundle of felt emotions your friend has, are terrifically different, compel different actions, are directed at different things.  And yet we use the same words.  Now go back to that first paragraph.  If what we wanted was TRUTH.  Then your friend and you could not use the word \"love\" to mean those two different groups of feelings and histories and etc.  Your particular feelings would need a word specific to it, and your friends would need a different particular word.  To sort of get through life, we go with the sloppier, functional system wherein you both say \"love\" and it works ok.  > What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding.  All that stuff we've gone over?  All the flaws and shortcomings of language, and our motivation for having that?  Nietzsche thinks we forget those nuances.  So, in life, your friend and you think that \"love\" really *is* the same thing, for both of you, since you use the same word.  Analogy/Example:  Lots of times marriages / relationships fall apart because, despite using the same words, folks *mean* different things.  Tom says \"I want to get married\" and Sue says \"I want to married\", so they get married, because they agree, right?  But then a month into the relationship, turns out Tom thinks that marriage entails a joint bank account and Sue thinks marriage entails separate bank accounts and also she gets a cake every Thursday.  So they're pissed off because they *meant* different things by \"marriage\".  That's kinda what Nietzsche is on about.  We forget that \"marriage\" means very different things to every person, because everyone using the same word, \"marriage\".  How could Tom and Sue have such a conflict about what they thought \"marriage\" entailed if they used the same word??  If we used the Truth language Nietzsche discussed in that first quote, the conflict would have been avoided because Tom would have said he wanted marriage-bankaccounts and Sue would have said she wanted marriage-cakes.  Two different expressions, so two different things, so they oughtn't get married.  > Only by forgetting this primitive world of metaphor can one live with any repose, security, and consistency ... But in any case it seems to me that \"the correct perception\"—which would mean \"the  adequate expression of an object in the subject\"—is a contradictory impossibility.  The only way to avoid that \"marriage\" problem above, that results from the Beatrice problem above, which results from the \"we just want to not be hurt\" problem above, would be to have that perfect, scientific, atomistic language where every person says \"I want marriage-jointbankaccounts-twokids-apetbird-etc.\" to fully articulate every nuance of everything they experience and express.  But we can't do that.  Because, fundamentally, language cannot do that.  Concepts cannot do that.  There is always a shortcoming.  > But man has an invincible inclination to allow himself to be deceived and is, as it were, enchanted with happiness when the rhapsodist tells him epic fables as if they were true  Despite all the problems, we keep using the system where we say \"marriage\".  Because that is easier, and we think next time it will work, and we forget why it was a problem in the first place.  Tom and Sue blame each other, rather than the words and metaphors and basic structures of reality.  Blaming those things would be *scarier* than just blaming each other.  This is way longer than I intended so I will stop.  Did some of that make sense?"

It's over 1,000 pages and intended for people with a background in mathematics so there's probably quite a bit of mathematics in there you'll have to learn on your own in order to be able to follow, but it really is quite a beautiful serious introduction to the main ideas in modern physics, especially theoretical physics.  Good luck, and happy learning!  Edit: Oh, and I wouldn't recommend any pop-science string-theory stuff. Some of them are quite good as far as reading for enjoyment (I liked Brian Greene's *The Elegant Universe*) but the topic is sooo complex that you'll really get virtually zero sense of *WHY* string theorists believe the stuff they believe, since the mathematics is far too complicated for the lay audience. In other words, it's not particularly helpful from a philosophical point of view. If you have absolutely no knowledge of relativity, Hawking's *A Brief History of Time* is a good really basic intro."

    "golden_answer": " Some philosophers would question the notion as to whether we should assume there ever was a cause to the universe, thereby solving your infinite regression dilemma. In other words, how are we to know that matter hasn’t always existed, if even in a condensed form?  David Hume comes to mind. In his *Treatise of Human Nature*, he makes the observation that the Cosmological Argument for the necessary existence of God is built on the presupposition that X leads to Y, but that we only believe X causes Y because that’s all we’ve ever experienced. However, as Hume argues, we shouldn’t assume the notion that X leads to Y applies to all things—or that because there is matter, therefore there must have been a cause (God). Just because causal relationships between the existence of things is all that we have observed does not mean that we should assume this applies to matter itself, of which a cause has yet to be observed.  As Hume illustrates, just because every swan we see pass under the bridge is white does not mean the next swan we see pass under the bridge will also be white; just because all we have seen are white swans, does not mean that all swans are white.

    "golden_answer": " God is not a who, in Spinoza.  The Appendix to Book 1 has a good overview of what Spinoza tries to say about God, written in a manner that is more approachable to most readers.  > All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view. It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship him). I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it ? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.  God, in Spinoza, is not an invisible man living in the sky.

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is Math real?  Anyone want to talk about whether math is 'real' or not? This is one of  my favorite topics in philosophy and I rarely get a chance to talk t  others about it. I am in no way an expert.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " As with everything in philosophy, this is controversial. It's also controversial in more than one way. That's because realism in the philosophy of mathematics can generally be split into two types. Firstly, there is **sentence realism** and secondly, **object realism**. Sentence realism says that all mathematical sentences are objectively true or false, and usually also that currently accepted mathematical theory is true. Object realism says that mathematical objects exist.  One theory that would answer an emphatic yes to your question would be **platonism**. Platonism is the view that there exist mathematical objects like numbers and sets. Platonism also says that these objects are abstract: i.e. that they cannot cause things to happen and that they have no spatio-temporal location. These are quite common sense properties to give to things like numbers - it seems unlikely that we could one day find the number 2 floating out in space somewhere and it would be likewise quite surprising if we found that the empty set was somehow causing things to happen in the physical world. Platonism also has the advantage of making the meanings of mathematical sentences common-sensical as well. Why is \"2 is a prime number\" true? Well according to the platonist, in exactly the same way as \"Jupiter is a planet\" is. In other words, \"2 is a prime number\" is true because there really exists an object called \"2\" and it really is a prime number, the sentence accurately describes it. Overall platonism is both object realist and sentence realist. However, there are also views that are sentence realist without being object realist.  **Modal structuralism** is such a view. Modal structuralism says that mathematics is objectively true, but not because abstract numbers exist. It says that mathematical sentences aren't even making claims about mathematical objects, they're making claims about structure. To understand this let's consider the structure of the natural numbers.  0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → ...  The natural numbers start with 0. Following 0 we have 1. The technical term for this is that 1 is the successor of 0. The structure of the natural numbers is that every number (starting from 0) has a successor and only a single successor, and the chain goes off to infinity. If there was an infinitely long queue with a person at the front of the queue followed by a line of others, that would be exactly the same structure. The person at the front of the queue would be acting the part of 0, the people behind them the rest of the numbers. For the modal structuralist, \"2 is a prime number\" is really saying that if a structure like this were to actually exist, then whatever was playing the part of 2 would have special properties because of the structure it is a part of. Overall modal structuralism says that mathematics is making claims about hypothetical structures, about what they would have to be like if they existed, but it doesn't have to say that such structures actually do exist. It's hard to say whether this view would make mathematics \"real\", it would certainly make it objective!  Another view in the philosophy of mathematics is **mathematical fictionalism**. Mathematical fictionalism says that mathematical sentences can be true or false, but that they are in fact all false because mathematical objects do not exist. This seems to answer your question with an emphatic no. However, there are agreements between even platonism and fictionalism. It's probably important to note some things that are uncontroversial amongst all views. Nobody disputes that mathematicians exist, that they're doing this thing that they call \"mathematics\", and that this so-called mathematics has turned out to be very useful indeed, perhaps especially in its application to the natural sciences (one key aim for fictionalists is in explaining why mathematics is useful even though it is not true). One thing that platonism and fictionalism agree on - but disagree with modal structuralism on - is that mathematical sentences are about mathematical objects. This brings us to another view: **formalism**. Formalism argues that mathematical sentences don't really mean anything at all. For formalists, mathematics is akin to a game like chess. There are rules about how you can manipulate the symbols just like there are rules about how you can move the chess pieces, but this doesn't mean that these symbols actually have to represent anything. If mathematics is about anything, it's about symbols, not numbers (so says the formalist).  A final view to add something interesting is the mathematical **figuralism** of Stephen Yablo. Yablo compares mathematics to figurative language. Think of sentences like \"the clouds were angry\". A sentence like that is clearly not literally true (clouds can't feel emotions) but there is a certain sense in which it carries a lot of information that might give an accurate picture of the world, or it might be inaccurate. If the clouds are dark and thick, the sentence is kind of true in a figurative way at least. If the clouds are bright on a blue sky, the sentence is just a lie. To push this further, let's think about a game of make-believe. In this game, all trees are terrifying bears. In the context of this game, pointing at a tree and shouting \"there's a bear!\" is true in a similar non-literal kind of way. The important thing here is that the make-believe is prop-oriented; what counts as \"true\" and \"false\" in the game depends on objective features of the actual real world. To point at a rose and say \"there's a bear\" is not only wrong, it goes against an objective standard of being even figuratively true. Likewise, what if mathematics make-believes the existence of numbers so that we can track information about physical things. If this were the case, mathematics would kind of not be real, but there would still be an objective standard for which mathematical sentences are *figuratively* true.  Hopefully this is useful and gives a flavour of a few different positions on this.  (edit: improve wording in a few places)"

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: Is it morally justified to commit suicide? Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus”. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don’t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life—it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning “philosophical suicide”; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.   But what if Sisyphus COULD choose to commit suicide (in the Atheist sense) and therefore cease to exist? Would this option disallow—or make it more difficult for—Sisyphus to find meaning and happiness in his suffering?   Additionally, in a practice sense: Do I own my body? If so, why can’t I commit suicide without any moral consequences? Since suicide is illegal, doesn’t that mean that the State owns my body? Furthermore, doesn’t the idea that suicide is selfish even more so indicate that the collective owns my body?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I think Camus was saying that if one commits suicide, it would mean that the person answered the question of life’s meaning, because only then can you rationally decide whether the meaning is worth it or not. But Camus says that it is impossible to answer this question because of the absurdity of life which he compares to Sisyphus’s task. I think you’re a little confused in the sense that you think of Sisyphus’s act as “suffering”. As far as I understand Camus, he is in fact suggesting that it is impossible to know whether Sisyphus’s task is truly even suffering or not, but it is surely absurd. Acknowledging this fact and the fate of it conquers it and therefore you can live in content acceptance."

A bit of background, Im very new to Philosophy, and already Im finding myself contradicting on further reading many of the interpretations I adopted regarding Philosophies and Philosophers. My question is how do I avoid falling to the misrepresentations and misinterpretations of Philosophers, so that I can get the most accurate, reading of the philosophies and philosophers?  Thank you.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " I've split my advice into two sections, as I think there's two parts to this. The first is when you're reading or learning of a philosopher, and the second is when you're asked to 'represent' a philosophy or philosophy in public or in an essay.  &#x200B;  **Reading/Getting to grips with an author**  1) Read genuinely, with good faith, and ideally twice – once skimming, and not too bothered about getting it 'right', then do a proper read to understand each paragraph.   2) Take advantage of the introductions of great authors – they're designed to introduce and prime you to learn what someone is saying, rather than interpret the text for you in a specific way (with some exceptions for late Continental authors, who it's very hard to read without interpreting).  3) Read the context of an author – frankly, that can be wikipedia in some cases, as much as people will hate me for saying that. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is also good, as is IETP. Scholarly articles and history books are great of course, but obviously longer and varying quality. Machiavelli makes more sense knowing the context of 15th century Italy, even if his message is timeless (sorry Straussians who may disagree with me).   4) Read what great scholars of that author have to say about what the author thinks. Reading Seyla Benhabib, Etienne Balibar, and Serena Parekh's views of Arendt are what gives you a masterful understanding of Arendt, above reading her primary work. This requires understanding *who* the great authors are, but knowing (2) and (3) helps you do (4). If you don't understand where they're coming from, pin down the bit where they \"lose\" you, and drill into that.  Doing all this means you've read the main texts at least twice, multiple supporting authors, and a history of the person you're studying. At that point, you've done the groundwork to understand an issue.  Keep in mind reading is ***hard***. It's not like reading fiction – you're *studying*, and studying tough texts. Take time, don't expect to get the answer immediately, and assume you're standing on the shoulders of giants. Great authors have written crap (Plato's rants about Phyrgian music come to mind), but great texts are great for a reason, and you're much more likely to not 'get' something than you are to have found an insightful new criticism.  &#x200B;  **Writing/Expressing your View**  1) Follow PEARL in your essay-writing: Point, evidence, analysis, reference, link. Point is a short statement of what you're saying the author says. Evidence is a primary quote. Analysis is explaining in your own modern short words what the author says. Reference is a secondary source which reinforces what you're saying, giving you a clue of the overall context. And link brings it back to your original point. For (a rushed) example:  >*Arendt is sceptical of human rights' ability to protect one's liberty. In* Origins of Totalitarianism*, Arendt says clearly that human rights are the rights of those with \"the loss of home and political status\". That means they're the rights of those without a polity to defend their rights – for Arendt, the source of human rights. As Serena Parekh says,* “human rights rights are for when civil rights have failed” *- Parekh is saying only those without protection, rely on human rights. And that protection, for Arendt, necessarily comes from belonging to a polity, i.e. from political status. This reinforces my overall thesis: statism is essential to Arendt's politics. Her scepticism of human rights is part of her belief in the essential nature of the state.*  Writing simply in PEARL means you're forcing yourself to stick to the original source tightly. You can of course write differently and well, and writing in PEARL doesn't mean you're writing truth, but it forces you to continually refer to primary and secondary sources.   As a note, PEARL doesn't lend itself to disagreeing with sources, i.e. writing 'John says X; I say Y'. There's other kinds of writing styles PEARL doesn't lend itself towards. But for the majority of ideas, writing in PEARL is helpful.  2) Put in three points what an author is saying in a text. Everything can be simplified into bullet point lists no more than 5-7 points long, and everything can be oversimplified into three key ideas. This is a judgment exercise, but doing so distils an author down and gives you a point of reference to make sure you're consistent in your interpretation of an author, which helps you avoid misinterpretation – most misinterpretation from students at all levels are revealed by inconsistency (John says Hobbes says x; that maybe makes sense in passage y, but what about passage z?). So avoiding inconsistency through summarising an author's points, is immensely helpful.  3) Talk to your peers! While lecturers and professors will tell you very often, \"it depends\", your peers will often go \"this bit makes \\*\\*\\*\\* all sense\", or have a view to what an author is saying in passage Y, that is a gross oversimplification *that gives a clear view to what an author says*. You don't need to be perfect in an interpretation, just in the right ballpark – you don't need to get Hobbes' theory of statehood exactly right, as long as you know he is very staunchly in favour of the state for stability. Academics argue endlessly about the exact right interpretation of authors; your job is to get it *roughly* right, i.e. *not objectively wrong*. Do that by talking to your peers, and getting validation that your interpretation isn't mad.  &#x200B;  This is a long guide of my views on the matter – hope it helps, and feel free to follow up with any questions. Cheers."

Consider this; the vast majority of what the brain does is NOT experienced consciously.

Therefore: —> complex neuronal activity CAN and DOES happen without necessarily needing to be consciously observed (or without needing to give rise to a conscious experience).

    "golden_answer": " >Can we all agree, at least, that the neurosceintific theory of consciousness is, at best, mind-boggling and profoundly uncomfortable to accept.  There are many philosophers who agree. Thomas Nagel for example, writes the following in his famous paper What is it like to be a bat?, from 1974:  >If we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done. The problem is unique. If mental processes are indeed physical processes, then there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo certain physical processes. What it is for such a thing to be the case remains a mystery.  Frank Jackson is another, who wrote a famous paper in 1982, Epiphenomenal Qualia, outlining the inadequacies of physicalism (the view that everything is physical, including consciousness). He and others, which he refers to as \"qualia freaks\" thought the argument was very simple, and stated it as follows:  >Nothing you could tell of a physical or neurobiological] sort captures the smell of a rose, for instance. Therefore, Physicalism is false.   There are many who cannot see the intuitiveness of this short argument, hence the rest of his famous paper is spelling that intuition out in the form of The Knowledge Argument.  Here's another famous philosopher Colin McGinn in 1991 from *The Mysterious Flame: Conscious Minds in a Material World*:  >It is not that we know what would explain consciousness but are having trouble finding the evidence to select one explanation over the others; rather, we have no idea what an explanation of consciousness would even look like.  Here's Jerry Fodor in 1998 in his *In Critical Condition: Polemical Essays on Cognitive Science and the Philosophy of Mind*:  >[We don’t know], even to a first glimmer, how a brain (or anything else that is physical) could manage to be a locus of conscious experience. This ... is, surely, among the ultimate metaphysical mysteries; don’t bet on anybody ever solving it.  This is a small sample of fairly well known philosophers that agree with your sentiment, and there are many others, such as David Chalmers, and Philip Goff who have been mentioned.   There are also others that strongly disagree with your sentiment though and /u/FrenchKingWithWig has done a good job of outlining a response to your sentiment that some philosophers take, including a very famous one, Dan Dennett. So the relationship between consciousness and the brain is an old problem that is currently unsolved. So although you may feel adamant that an explanation in terms of the brain is not sufficient, it's important to recognize that many disagree, and if you are interested in understanding their viewpoints you would do well to read someone like Dennett. The [SEP article on Consciousness is also a great place to start."

Therefore, the personality determines what will happen. One could describe a personality as a set of inhibitions and/or motivations to make one decision or another. The Quran says that God is good. That, along with the fact that God made the decision to create this specific universe, suggests that God has a personality. But if God has a personality, that would be an entity more fundamental than God since it is what determines reality. But God is supposed to be the most fundamental entity, right?

This is a peculiar inference, since it treats God's personality as a separate entity from God, which is a peculiar way to speak of a personality.

Yet I’ve seen people reject utilitarianism even though, at least at first glance, it seems to be the moral position that makes the most sense. What exactly is wrong with it?\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " Here is a comment I've made before. The below is meant to just highlight some areas that different objections can be pursued; it's not meant to be some standalone \"final word\" on the matter. I put this disclaimer at the beginning because I am not interested in \"debating\" responses to the below (as some people *really* want to when they read the below, though I'm happy to try and clarify things); I'm merely highlighting different avenues that have been pursued.  So: Much of this will certainly depend on exactly how utilitarianism is cashed out.  So, first, let's get a general statement of utilitarianism on the board. How about this: \"an act is right if and only if it maximizes happiness in the world.\" Now, we could get more precise, but we can use that as a working understanding. As you note, things might change if we move to preference-utilitarianism, or rule utilitarianism   Here are some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with:  1. Utilitarianism looks to make the notion of \"rights\" obsolete. For instance, tossing Christians to the lions in ancient Rome is bad for the Christian, but good for the Colosseum of Romans who are in ecstasy at the spectacle. If you have enough ecstatic Romans, then it looks like it's good, given utilitarianism, to toss the Christian to the lions.   2. Utilitarianism is too demanding. It seems to demand that that we always are to maximize happiness, in every action, at all times. And that's very, very, hard-- and hard in a way that seem to be too much of a cost for a moral theory.  3. Utilitarianism tries to put a single metric on value, and that's incoherent. Can we really compare the sort of value you assign to the life of your wife, with the value you assign to eating a Twinkie, with the value you assign to relieving yourself, with the value you assign to living the life of monk? For many people, it does not seem that all things that we value in life can be compared. e.g. I value twinkies. I also value my wife. How many twinkies is my wife worth to me? Utilitarianism asks questions like that all the time; for many people the question is ridiculous as a comparison is impossible. Some things differ in kind, not just in quantity. The point to be made is that the utilitarian assigns a single metric to all value, and that seem incoherent. The utilitarian says that the type of value got from scratching an itch is commensurable with the value of my wife. So, there will exist a relationship, such that some number times the value of itching a scratch equals the value of my wife. But, we might say, any equation looks wrong here. As Kant says, life has a dignity, and not just a price. The sorts of value involved here are incommensurable, if comparable.  4. Utilitarianism is under-specified, and when it is specified, those specifications are largely arbitrary. For instance, do we maximize aggregate happiness, or average happiness? Who is included? People, animals, future generations? How do we weigh \"high probability of little pleasure\" vs \"low probability of high pleasure\"? Here's another problem: assuming we can calculate the relevant utils, how do we deal with time? Do we look a second ahead, a year ahead or a century ahead? But why stop at a century? Why not 101 years, or 500 years or 865.324 years, or the second before all sentient beings are extinct? The normative prescription provided by utilitarianism can change from instant to instant. So what do you make of a theory that tells you that a certain action will produce a net +10 utils at time t, a net -5 utils at t+1, a net +100 utils at t+2, a net -1000 utils at t+3, etc, etc? If net utility can change from instant to instant (and it obviously can), then utilitarianism is of no service to moral agents in deciding how to act or how to value an action.  5. Utilitarianism seems to be a self-effacing theory in that there seem to be situations where making utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system would actually produce less utility. So, utilitarianism might very well be a theory that works best if no one is thinking about it....very odd.  6. Related to 5. Utilitarianism tells us that an act is right if and only if it is optimific in regard to pleasure and pain. But you can't embody this reason in your motive for acting, and still have friends, loved-ones, etc. Under utilitarianism, you don't value your friends as *friends*, you value them as sources of pleasure; they are replaceable -- anything with the same effects on us will suffice. So, when you try to embody utilitarianism in your motives, you find that the person you supposedly love engages your thought not for him/her but as a source of pleasure. To embody in one's motives the values of utilitarianism is to treat people externally and to preclude love, affection, community. To get *these* goods while holding utilitarianism requires a schizophrenia between reason and motive. To the extent that you live utilitarianism, you will fail to achieve goods like friendship, love, inquiry -- and these are goods that the utilitarian himself recognizes as good. The objection is that you cannot embody your reason in your motives, as a utilitarian. The utilitarian says that friends, and love are goods. But you can't achieve these goods, while simultaneously embodying your reason in your motive.            Compare to the egoist: egoists take their own pleasure as the sole justification. From this, they should recognize the love, etc as among personal pleasures; so they have good reason on their own grounds to enter such relations. But when they act on their motive of pleasure-for-self they can't get those pleasures; to achieve these pleasures they have to abandon their egoistical motive; the egoist can't get the pleasures of love and friendship. For it is essential to the very concept of love that one care for the beloved, and be prepared to act for the sake of the beloved as a final goal. But to the extent that my consideration for you comes from my desire to lead a life that is personally pleasing, I do not act for your sake. So their motive and reasons pull apart. So, to get these goods they have to lead a sort of schizophrenic life.       Here's sort of how Susan Wolf understands the point: the utilitarian values these things only because of and insofar as they are a part of the general happiness. He values them under the description, “a contribution to the general happiness.” In contrast, real people might love, say, literature, because of the insights into human nature, or, growing roses because they are beautiful. Sure this may contribute to happiness, but this isn't the point to the non-utilitarian. For if one values these activities in more direct ways, one may not be willing to exchange them for others that produce an equal, or even greater amount of happiness. From that point of view, it is not because they produce happiness that these activities are valuable; it is because these activities are valuable in more direct and specific ways that they produce happiness. So, the utilitarian can't value things in the right way.   So, those are some basic problems. I should note, though, that utilitarians are smart people, and can give responses-- indeed, utilitarians have given responses, but the above is just supposed to be the basic sorts of issues that lead to needed refinement/argument. One of the big responses you'll see is that \"utilitarianism is not a decision procedure!\" By this, the utilitarian means that you should take the theory as reporting when actions are \"good\" and when they are \"bad.\" So, on this reading, we shouldn't use the theory of utilitarianism to decide how to act on particular occasions. (Indeed, many utilitarians grant that, in deciding how to act, it is counterproductive to consult the theory of utilitarianism). Moreover, just because it's difficult to determine what action maximizes happiness isn't a mark against the theory -- it just shows we are limited in our knowledge. Moreover, utilitarians will be utilitarian about how they assign praise and blame. So, for instance, say I jump in the water and, unbeknownst to me, save Hitler Jr., who goes to murder a bunch of people. Well, utilitarians might still praise my act as the right one (since, they want to promote saving drowning folk), even though my action was actually \"bad\" (since it led to a decrease in utility). Another way to see the same point: just because I do a bad action, doesn't mean I should be blamed for it, since whether or not I'm to be blamed is something we have to think about along utilitarian lines.  Some of the more spelled out versions of utilitarianism are interesting and deep. But, the sort of utilitarianism you sometimes see in economics, law, public policy, may be \"too quick.\"  It may have a certain air of \"spurious rigour,\" where we mistake quantification and calculation for cogency of thought. It might be a great moral theory for omniscient beings (though even this is in question). But for those of us who lack that quality, utilitarianism may be seen as just a device to cloak moral bias with the guise of mathematical certainty. There's definitely more to be said, but I'll end there for now."

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: How exactly does spinoza bridge the is-ought gap? I'm having a hard time seeing how he goes from all things having a conatus to this conatus implying certain virtues we need to follow.\n\nAssistant:",
    "golden_answer": " It depends a lot on what you mean, which is why you have received so many different correct answers.  Strictly speaking, the is-ought problem as articulated by Hume in book III, part I, section I of A Treatise of Human Nature is  > In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; **when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not.** This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, **for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.** But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.  The is-ought problem, as articulated by Hume, is when a philosophical treatise moves from making \"is\" claims to making \"ought\" claims, without explaining how the shift is made.  Spinoza solves that problem by not making the shift from \"is\" to \"ought\".  Spinoza's ethical claims are based on statements of what things *are*.  3P6:  Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persist in its own being.  3P7  The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being, is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question.  Spinoza does not make prescriptive claims that a thing *ought* to strive to endeavor to persist in being.  He just says that is what things do.  Another good example is 4P14:  Every man, by the laws of his nature, necessarily desires or shrinks from that which he deems to be good or bad.  > The knowledge of good and evil is (IV. viii.) the emotion of pleasure or pain, in so far as we are conscious thereof; therefore, every man necessarily desires what he thinks good, and shrinks from what he thinks bad. Now this appetite is nothing else but man's nature or essence (cf. the Definition of Appetite, III. ix. note, and Def. of the Emotions, i.). Therefore, every man, solely by the laws of his nature, desires the one, and shrinks from the other, &c.  Q.E.D.  In Spinoza's system, it is not that one *ought to* desire what one thinks good, or *ought to* shrink from the bad.  But rather \"every man, solely by the laws of his nature, desires the one, and shrinks from the other.\"  That's just what man is, and that's just what man does.  Hume's articulation of the is-ought gap would only apply to Spinoza if, say, Books 1 through 2 contained is claims about how God works and how Humans, work, and then suddenly in Books 3 through 5 Spinoza shifted to how Humans ought to live given the claims in the first two books.  Spinoza never makes that shift, so far as I recall.  Spinoza is is claims all the way down, so to speak.  Which either means that  * Spinoza bridges the is-ought gap by making reconfiguring prescriptive ethical claims as \"is\" claims.  * Spinoza does not bridge the gap because he never hops from \"is\" speak to \"ought\" speak.  I think it's more the first than the second, but both are probably right."

It occured to me today how much Lovecraft's \"cosmic horror\" draws from the earlier aesthetic notions of the sublime, especially in Burke and Kant's conception; something that overwhelms the senses with some degree of dimension and danger.   The jest, of course, is that cosmic horror is not at all pleasurable to the observer, unlike something sublime. Maybe it approximates the Lacanian Real?  In any case, it also seems to me that horror (in literature, cinema, plastic arts) rarely receives a critical treatment like other genres. While there maybe be horror masterpieces which are undoubtedly art, it seems that very few people would list those as the best of a certain medium.

    "golden_answer": " Justifying punishment is a difficult problem in philosophy of law because it involves both moral condemnation and infliction of harm. In liberal societies (liberal here is used in the philosophical sense, not in the everyday politics sense that describes people on the left), governments are traditionally expected to remain morally neutral most of the time and to promote the public good. It seems hard to justify harm and condemnation as consistent with neutrality and the public good. The two primary categories of justification philosophers have used are forward-looking and backward-looking theories. Forward-looking theories attempt to justify punishment by appealing to some positive effect it will have, such as deterrence. Backward-looking theories attempt to right a previous wrong or respond to a wrong that was committed, such as be seeking retribution.  The most straightforward forward-looking theory is a bare-bones consequentialist theory. Consequentialism only cares about the consequences of a decision, so punishment would only be justified if it had some good effect. There are problems with consequentialist theories, primarily their lack of consistency and lack of respect for individual rights. Murphy lays out these problems and justifies his own retributive theory of punishment in chapter 4 of this book. That chapter will give you a good idea of this whole problem if you want to read it.  Murphy’s retributive theory of punishment is backward-looking and seeks to right a wrong and restore justice to the community. He is explicitly against merely seeking retribution for retribution’s own sake. That would be the lex talionis or “eye for an eye” view, which is unpopular. Rather, Murphy’s view is that when a crime has been committed, a wrong has been done to the community’s shared sense of what is right. An injustice has occurred. In order to restore justice to the community, the criminal must be punished. In Murphy’s view, the criminal is being punished not simply as revenge, but in order to restore justice.  Kelly criticizes Murphy’s view in this paper. Kelly believes Murphy’s approach does not avoid retributivism’s problems. She puts forward her own forward-looking view based primarily on deterrence, but she also seeks to avoid consequentialism’s pitfalls. Kelly’s theory relies on treating all criminals equally and giving them all fair warning. In Kelly’s view, this equality and fairness is sufficient to retain a respect for individual dignity and justice even as criminals are punished. Kelly realizes the we cannot simply blame criminals for their actions, but she thinks that punishment can still be just if it is done in the right way. So Kelly recognizes objections about a criminal’s circumstances, and thinks her theory gets around it.  Meanwhile, there are those who believe that punishment is unjustified, and are unconvinced by both forward- and backward-looking theories. These philosophers typically endorse restorative justice as an alternative, which seeks to rehabilitate criminals and right any wrongs without punishment. I am less familiar with these theories, but you can read more about them here. I linked the section of an encyclopedia article about restorative justice, but I’d bet that whole article would be illuminating.  Hope this helps"

Plato is pretty much the most influential thinker in western philosophy (I'll spare you the Whitehead quote), thus getting acquainted with him is a good start and important to understand many later positions.  2. Plato's works are accessible and easy to read (for philosophy standards, that is). The way they are written is also often genuinely entertaining, which can't be said for everything that has been written in philosophy.  3. Plato discusses a lot of the topics that are still central fields of inquiry in contemporary philosophy. Reading Plato thus serves as a great introduction into the topics of philosophy and - given that most philosophy today is written in papers which are either direct or indirect responses to other papers - in a way also into its methodology, as Plato wrote his works as dialogues (although, of course, there isn't a fixed set of methods in philosophy, I believe that goes without saying).  The Republic, Phaidon or Menon would be good places to start."

Certainly Redpuppet11 is right that what is going on in the play is related to Sartre's concept of \"the look\" and the way in which we find ourselves objectified by the mere idea of being held by a gaze.  Because of this, we are able to imagine ourselves as being looked at and, in turn, observed, judged, etc.  Thankfully, Sartre himself has a nice answer to this question:  > I mean that if relations with someone else are twisted, vitiated, then that other person can only be hell. Why? Because. . . when we think about ourselves, when we try to know ourselves, . . . we use the knowledge of us which other people already have. We judge ourselves with the means other people have and have given us for judging ourselves. Into whatever I say about myself someone else’s judgment always enters. Into whatever I feel within myself someone else’s judgment enters. . .  In the play, a big deal is made about the fact that there are two things missing from Hell: (1) eyelids and (2) mirrors.  Well, the connection is pretty blunt - the only way to see yourself in hell is through the eyes of others.  Our sense of ourselves is always already mediated by \"the look.\""
